She watched the girl at the top leap off the board’s edge and curl herself into a cannonball. The splash sent water running over Mei’s feet. <i>People do this all the time, right?

Selena raised her eyebrows. “Rocks?” she said. “Talking rocks? Alfy, I love you, but I think your head is full of rocks.”

“Just think about it!” he said. “Rocks are just about the oldest things on Earth. If we had some way of talking to them, imagine what they could tell us! They could tell us about the beginning of the planet! They could tell us about creatures we never even knew were real! They could tell us about the world’s most ancient people and how they lived! They could tell us everything!”

Selena looked interested now. “I guess it’s not a totally wacko idea,” she said. “But still, rocks aren’t alive, Alfy! They can’t even talk to each other, let alone us. There’s no way you’ve made a gadget that can do that.”

39,11,3,"Simon stared at the alien that sat on the metal table in the lab. It looked like an upside down jujube with a mouth. It didn’t have any eyes, but it’s wide mouth was smiling. It jiggled happily back and forth making odd squeaks. 

Professor Dinkluss looked at the strange creature and scratched his chin. “Well, I’ve done some tests,” he said. “And a few things are clear now.” He waved at Simon to come closer.

“I...think I’m okay back here for now. Thanks,” said Simon. 

“Suit yourself,” said the professor. He went on. “The first thing was to find out what it eats. That was not as easy as it might sound.”

“Picky eater, huh?” Simon said. 

“Exactly,” replied the professor. “I tried feeding it meat: steak, jerky, ham, spam, burgers, sushi. Nothing. No interest. Then I tried vegetables and fruits: broccoli, sprouts, raspberries, bananas. It sucked on a turnip for a while, but then spit it out. I tried blue cheese, and cotton candy, fried eggs, and chewing gum. I tried grass and tree bark and metal nails and nail polish. None of it was any good.” He smiled. “But then I finally figured it out.”

“So, what does it eat then?” Simon asked.

“Sunlight.” the professor said simply.

“Sunlight? How is that possible? No creature can <i>eat</i> sunlight!” Simon said.

“Oh no?” said the professor, curling an eyebrow. “Can’t you think of some living creatures on our own planet who do just that? Who use sunlight as their main source of energy to grow?”

Simon frowned, thinking. Then with a jolt, he realized. 

“Plants!” he cried. “Plants are sunlight eaters too!”

46,4,4,"The tooth fairy sighed. She still had more than sixty teeth to collect, and it was already past midnight. She flapped her tiny, tired wings and flew across the quiet streets. On one side she carried a bag full of coins. On the other was her bag full of baby teeth. The bags brushed the windowsill as she flew into the next child’s bedroom.

But what she saw inside made her stop suddenly in mid-air. What was this? There was already someone pulling a tooth out from under this child’s pillow! It couldn’t be another fairy - they had no interest in teeth. That was her job! She flew closer.

It was a little brown mouse. As she watched, it pulled a coin out of its mouse-sized backpack and pushed the money under the pillow. Then it carefully put the tooth in the backpack and zipped it up.

The tooth fairy couldn’t stand it anymore. She was supposed to be collecting that tooth! “What are you doing?” she said, in a whisper that was more of a shout.

The mouse looked up. “Oh, I’m sorry, are you here for the tooth?” it said. “You see, I’m the French tooth fairy. And this child is French. So this is actually <i>my</i> job.”

“But...but this is my area! I’m supposed to collect that tooth!” the tooth fairy said. She flew slowly down to the bed beside the child’s pillow.

The mouse shrugged its tiny mouse shoulders. “But this is a French tooth,” it said.

The tooth fairy couldn’t think of anything to say to that. The two small tooth fairies stared at each other. Then the child turned over in its sleep and broke the spell. The mouse ran smoothly up the desk to the window. The fairy flew up after it. They both stood on the windowsill for a moment, looking out at the moonlit night.

“Actually - can I ask you where you got that backpack?” the tooth fairy said finally. “These bags are really heavy and hard to fly with.”

“Oh! Of course!” said the mouse.

And just like that, they were friends.

The creature looked sort of like a very small old man. It had thin limbs and pale greyish skin. Its head was wider than a normal person’s, and its large eyes were a deep, glittering purple. Oddly enough, the creature did not seem to walk on its feet. Its scrawny arms held up its body while its legs were crossed and twisted like a pretzel behind its head. But strangest of all were the toenails growing from those feet: they were yellow, and jagged, and so long that they curled into spirals at the ends!

“What are you lookin’ at?” the thing growled at Marcus.

“Nothing!” Marcus replied at once. “I’ve just never seen a creature like you before.”

“Oh yeah?” it said. “We’re a rare kind. The world can’t handle too much of a beautiful thing, you know.” It carefully dug around in one nostril with the tip of a gnarled toenail.

“I...I guess not.” said Marcus. He turned to leave.

“You can call me Teegy,” the creature said, shuffling towards Marcus. He proudly extended a filthy, lumpy foot. (Marcus was relieved it wasn’t the foot with the booger still hanging off the end.) “Teegy of the Geegersneegers.”

She did it again and added in the second foot. <i>Thunk thunk</i>. She began tapping them back and forth, building up a rhythm until she heard a small cough from beside her. 

The only other person at the bus stop was a man with a newspaper. He looked old, like her daddy, but not as old as Grandpa. He was wearing an expensive suit with dark striped pants. As Moira looked at him he gave her a stern look over his newspaper. He didn’t say anything but eventually turned the page and went back to his reading.

“What are you waiting for, Mister?” Moira asked him.

“I beg your pardon, young lady?” he replied.

“I’m just wondering what you’re waiting for,” she said. “It’s a real hot day to just be sitting around in the sun like this. Like, just for fun or something.” 

“This is a bus stop,” he said, keeping his eyes on his newspaper. “I am waiting for the bus.”

Moira stopped staring at him and started pulling at a loose thread on her dress. “It just looks to me like you might be some kind of rich, fancy type of business person or something. People like that don’t usually take the bus.”

The man folded his paper down and looked at her. “Young lady, did you know that it’s rude to ask how much money someone has?”

“I wasn’t asking!” Moira replied, trying to look shocked. “I just said what it <i>looks</i> like, and I think I’m right. Anyway, all I really meant was that you can wait for all kinds of stuff at a bus stop. Just because busses stop here doesn’t mean that nothing else does.”

The man considered this. “Yes, I suppose you’re right. What are you waiting for, then?” he asked.

76,7,6,"Ever since Eli was a little boy, he knew about the house at the end of the lane. ""If you keep being naughty, you’re going to wind up in the house at the end of the lane,” his Oma would say, when he knocked over her paint pots. ""Where did you come from - the house at the end of the lane?” his Opa would say, if Eli ran too fast and bumped into him. And once, late at night before Eli went back home from Oma and Opa’s house, his Oma said quietly, ""Your mother went to the house at the end of the lane, you know. And she never came back.”

""That’s silly, Oma!” said Eli. ""She’s picking me up tomorrow at the airport!”

""Of course, my pet,” said his Oma, and she hugged him tight and sent him to bed. The next day at the airport, Eli looked into his mother’s dark eyes, but everything seemed normal. His mother smiled her sharp-toothed smile and hugged him tight and took him home, and Eli forgot all about it.

The next summer when he was back at his Oma and Opa’s, it was a hot, boring day and Eli felt restless. He answered rudely when his Opa asked him a question, and shrugged when his Oma asked if he’d like to watch her paint. ""What is this, the house at the end of the lane?” his Oma said. ""I think you need to go play outside.” She pinched his cheek, so Eli knew she wasn’t really angry, but it just made him more annoyed. He slammed the door as he left, and scuffed his feet in the dirt behind the apartment building. When he looked up, he saw the house.

It was at the end of the lane, just like he’d been told. There were boards across the windows and the door creaked as he opened it. Inside, it was cool and dark and very quiet. There was a long hallway, with closed doors all along it. When Eli walked down it, his feet left footprints in the dust. At the end of the hallway was a tall mirror.

""I’m not afraid,” Eli said out loud. He reached a hand up and wiped the dust off the mirror. His reflection stared out at him. Then he saw a dark shape over his shoulder. Before he could turn around, he felt a strong push on his back, and he fell headfirst towards the mirror.

Eli scrambled to his feet. He was on the other side of the mirror, trapped in a tall box. Standing in the hallway looking in at him was his reflection - but something was different. Eli slapped his hand on the mirror, and his reflection didn’t move. He shouted, and his reflection smiled. It had dark eyes and pointy teeth. It turned and walked down the hallway, through the door and out into the light.

“Did you put blue food coloring in the goldfish bowl yesterday morning?” he asked.

“No,” Jasmine replied. “Why would I do something stupid like that?”

“I don’t know,” Ezra said, pacing back and forth in front of her. “Maybe because Mr. Pondscum saw you pick your nose that one time. Maybe because you didn’t get to name him ‘Sir Swimmy Fins’ like you wanted. Or maybe because you just don’t like fish.”

“You’re crazy,” Jasmine said. “I don’t care about that fish one way or the other. Him or his ugly name. As far as I’m concerned he is just another decoration in the classroom.”

“Then maybe you think the classroom could do with a bit more blue in it?” Ezra asked, leaning in close.

“No, that’s not what I mean. I mean that I don’t really like Mr. Pondscum that much, but I don’t want anything bad to happen to him either.

King Minos was angry at them and was holding them prisoner. But Daedalus was a very creative man. He spent all day thinking of ways to escape.

One day Daedalus looked up at some birds flying by and got an idea: wings! If they had wings, they could fly off the island! So Daedalus collected all the bird feathers he could find. Then he stuck the feathers together with wax to make wings. At last he strapped one pair of wings to Icarus, and one to himself.

95,3,5,"In ancient times, there was a war between the Greeks and the city of Troy. It was called the Trojan War. Troy was a strong city with a great stone wall built all the way around it. No matter what they tried, the Greeks couldn’t get past that wall. Then one day they had a brilliant idea!

The Greeks built a gigantic wooden horse. It was beautiful on the outside. But it was hollow on the inside. That’s because a bunch of sneaky Greek soldiers were hiding inside of it! The rest of the Greeks sent a message to Troy. They said they were ready to give up and stop fighting. They said they had a gift to share with the people of Troy as a sign of friendship. So the Greeks rolled their giant wooden horse up to the gates of Troy and left it there.

The Trojans came out to see their present. It looked like a pretty nice huge wooden horse to them. And the Greeks were nowhere to be seen! So the Trojans opened the gates and rolled the horse into the city. As the people of Troy slept that night, the Greek soldiers crept out of their hiding place. They climbed out of the horse and opened the gates of Troy from the inside! Soon all the other Greek soldiers joined them and they finally defeated the Trojans!

100,10,5,"Lulu Stucy was a pretty laid-back gal. She was curious and she loved to explore. Sometimes she’d get distracted by the call of a strange bird or the swirling pattern in a rock and completely forget where she was going. But she didn’t mind, and that’s why everybody called her Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy. It was also because Lulu had a habit of losing things.

“You’d lose your head if it wasn’t screwed on!” Grandma Lucy Stucy was fond of saying to her. And Lulu never used to mind losing things either, until one day she woke up and just didn’t want to be Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy anymore. She went downstairs and told her older brother Brucey all about it.

“OK,” Brucey Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “I hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

Lulu was wearing a skirt that day and didn’t have any pockets, so she just held the quarter tight in her hand. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to that weird dark stairwell behind the cafeteria, and back to the classroom. But as she was walking home at the end of the day, she looked in her hand and realized the quarter was gone!

“Oh no!” Lulu cried. “I must have put it down somewhere and forgot to pick it back up!”

But the next day her brother gave her a second chance. “OK,” Brucey Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “This time I <i>rinky</i>-<i>dinky</i>-hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

Lulu made sure to wear jeans with pockets that day, so she slipped the quarter into her pocket and forgot all about it. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to the big room with all the blue mats in it beside the gym, and back to the classroom. But as she was walking home at the end of the day, she looked in her pocket and realized the quarter was gone!

“Oh no!” Lulu cried. “There’s a hole in my pocket and I didn’t know! The quarter must have fallen right through!”

But the next day her brother gave her a third chance. “OK,” Brucy Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “This time I <i>winky</i>-<i>finky</i>-rinky-dinky-hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

This time Lulu wasn’t taking any chances. She opened her backpack and slipped the quarter into a pouch, inside a pocket, zipped up the whole thing and then buckled the flap. Feeling confident, she forgot all about it. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to the water fountain on the third floor that shot water up your nose, and back to the classroom. As Lulu was walking home along a stream, she noticed a feather on the ground of a kind she had never seen before. She took off her backpack to put the feather inside, but just then her hand slipped and the bag went tumbling down into the stream.

When Lulu got home she was so sad that she could barely hold her head up. “What’s the matter?” asked her brother, Brucey.

“I lost my backpack AND the quarter,” Lulu sniffed. “I’m gonna be Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy forever.”

Brucey looked at her. “You know, nobody is good at everything, but everybody has some things that they’re great at. We’re all good at different things and that’s what makes us, <i>us</i>! I don’t lose things very often, but I’m so clumsy that they should call me Brucey-Stucy-Drops-The- Juicy!” Lulu laughed. “And our baby sister sure is cute, but I’m about to start calling her Whoopsie-Poopsie-Baby-Stucy!” The baby giggled in her high-chair. “And Lulu, you might lose things a lot, but you also find things that nobody else sees. Look at that cool feather in your pocket! I’ve never seen one like it!”

Lulu went over and hugged her big brother. “Thanks, Brucey,” she said.

“No problem, sis,” he replied. “Besides, maybe there is a way to stop you from losing things all the time. We haven’t tried duct tape yet!”

118,12,5,"When Iguana was just a little lizard, Iguana Mama told him all about what made iguanas special. She told him that iguanas were reptiles, and that they had spikes and scales, and that they were cold-blooded.

“Cold-blooded” made Iguana think of a cold, hard heart made of ice, and of tough guys wearing leather jackets and sunglasses. So, Iguana found a spot by himself on the branch of a tree and sat there in the shade, wearing his shades.

Awhile later, a monkey came along and saw Iguana sitting on his branch alone. “Hey there, Iguana!” he said. “You look a little lonely on that branch by yourself. I was just on my way to meet some friends at Sunny Rock to do some monkeying around, wanna come hang?”

“No,” Iguana replied. “I am one cold-blooded iguana. I have hard scales and big spikes. I’m tough, I’m mean, and my heart is made of ice! I don’t feel nothin’ and I don’t need nobody!”

So, off the monkey went to Sunny Rock without him.

Awhile later, a parrot came along and saw Iguana sitting on the branch alone. “Hey there, Iguana!” she said. “You look like you could use someone to talk to. I was just on my way to meet some friends at Sunny Rock and have a chat, wanna come ruffle some feathers?”

“No,” Iguana replied. “I am one cold-blooded iguana. I have hard scales and big spikes. I’m tough, I’m mean, and my heart is made of ice! I don’t feel nothin’ and I don’t need nobody!”

So, off the parrot went to Sunny Rock without him.

Awhile later, a jaguar came along and saw Iguana sitting on his branch alone. “Hey there, Iguana!” he said. “It looks like the sun is about to go behind those clouds. It might be cold here in the shade. I was just about to go stretch out and get nice and warm at Sunny Rock, wanna come take a cozy cat-nap?”

“No,” Iguana replied. “I am one cold-blooded iguana. I have hard scales and big spikes. I’m tough, I’m mean, and my heart is made of ice! I don’t feel nothin’ and I don’t need nobody!”

So, off the jaguar went to Sunny Rock without him.

Just then the sun did go behind the clouds, and Iguana’s spot became darker and shadier than ever. Behind his shades, Iguana could hardly see anything at all! Without the heat of the sun, Iguana became colder and colder until he was shivering up on his branch. 

Suddenly, Iguana heard the familiar voice of Iguana Mama calling to him. “Iguana, what are you doing up there on that cold, dark branch all alone? You’re going to freeze!”

“But, Mama,” Iguana replied, “I’m a cold-blooded iguana, just like you said! I have hard scales and big spikes. I’m tough, I’m mean, and my heart is made of ice! I don’t feel nothin’ and I don’t need nobody!”

“Oh, Iguana,” sighed Iguana Mama, “being cold-blooded doesn’t mean your heart is made of ice, and it doesn’t mean you can’t feel! In fact, it actually means you feel everything EXTRA intensely! Your body is SO sensitive that if you sit somewhere hot, your whole body gets hot, and if you sit somewhere cold, your whole body gets cold!”

“But what about my spikes?” Iguana asked. “And what about my scales?” 

“Sometimes the critters that look toughest on the outside are really the ones that are most sensitive on the inside,” said Iguana Mama.

119,10,5,"They had come too far to turn back now. Aidan stood at the top of the tall hill and looked down into the park below. Everything was covered in a thick layer of icy snow. The kids playing in their bright snowsuits at the bottom looked like little wriggling gummy bears from so high up. Some were playing tag, some were throwing snowballs, and one kid seemed to have gotten his head stuck in a snow drift so that only his little kicking legs were sticking out. Aidan could see them all. It had not been easy to get here, but they were finally ready to do what they had come to do: go sledding down the biggest hill in town.

They had overcome many hurdles to reach the top of that hill. Earlier that day when his friends Tara and Jack had arrived at Aidan’s house, the idea was already brewing in his mind. 

""What should we do today?” Tara asked, sitting cross-legged and chewing on a strand of her hair. ""It’s so grey outside that I forget what the sun looks like. Do you think we’ll ever wear shorts again? I miss having a sunburn, is that normal?” She flopped backwards onto the carpet.

""I don’t know,” Jack sighed.

""No,” Aidan said, grinning at the others. ""We’re going to make history! We’re going to have an adventure! We’re going to conquer The Reckless Ridge, The Crazy-Man’s Cliff– we’re going to sled down the Cedarvale Hill!”

Tara and Jack both stared at him. The hair even fell out of Tara’s mouth. Then, slowly, they both began to smile as well, an excited look on each face.

""Yes!” Jack cried, punching the air. ""We’re going to sled down the Cedarvale Hill! We’re gonna do it! Let’s go right now! Let’s–”

That’s when the first of their troubles appeared, and it sounded like Aidan’s mom. ""Oh no you’re not.” She called matter-of-factly from some distant room in the house. ""That Cedarvale Hill is way too dangerous! No way you kids are sliding down that death trap!”

""But, Mom!” Aidan yelled back at the ceiling in the general direction of his mother’s voice. ""All we’re gonna do is–”

""Nope!” the voice interrupted him, this time seeming to come from the hall on their left. ""It’s too icy out anyway. The snow won’t even be good for sledding! It’ll be one big ice slope. No way.”

""But, MOM!” Aidan cried.

""I guess maybe your mom’s right,” Jack said quietly. ""It is super icy out there today. The whole park will be like a big lumpy skating rink.”

""I’m always right, Jack! Just like <i>your</i> mother! And smart children listen to us!” the voice replied. They heard a door close.

""How did she even hear that?” Tara whispered.

""I hear everything,” said the voice of Aidan’s mom. ""So, don’t you kids get up to any trouble.”

Looking annoyed but determined, Aidan silently signalled to the others that they should go down to the cellar. Once they were down there, they used a scrap piece of paper to write and draw back and forth until they came up with a plan: they would build a giant blanket fort in the living room and bring the family laptop inside. Then, they would start a movie playing and crank the volume way up, so that if Aidan’s mom came by, she would just think they were sitting around in there watching it. Then they would sneak out of the house through the cellar door, slide down the hill a few times, set some world records for amazing bravery, and sneak back into the house before the movie was over without anyone being the wiser! It was brilliant.

<i>Sounds like a plan! </i>Tara wrote. <i>Where do you keep your sled?</i>

And that’s when Aidan realized the big problem at the core of his brilliant scheme: he didn’t have a sled! As if she could read Aidan’s mind, Tara smacked her forehead with the palm of her hand. 

But, not ready to give up just yet, Aidan held up a finger to tell them to wait. He started poking in a cupboard in a corner of the room and returned a moment later with three black plastic garbage bags in his hand. The other two looked stunned. Jack began shaking his head forcefully. Aidan began nodding, the grin back on his face. Tara rolled her eyes. They put the plan in motion.

Once the fort was built and the movie was playing, Tara, Jack, and Aidan crept quietly back down to the cellar. They had listened for a while to hear if Aidan’s mom was onto them, but she seemed to have gone quiet. They hurried to slip on their boots and coats without making any noise. As they were about to leave, Jack began trying to signal something to both of them. He was wiggling his arms around energetically and pointing, his face going red with the effort. Aidan looked at Tara and she shrugged. Neither of them had any idea what Jack was trying to say. Jack gave up and found another piece of scrap paper:

<i>If we are going down the biggest hill in town on nothing more than a square of plastic, </i>he wrote, <i>then I think we might want some kind of body armour. Trash bags don’t steer so well.</i>

Five minutes later each one of them was wearing at least three layers of puffy winter jackets, and Jack even had an old hockey helmet on for good measure. They were finally ready.



When they reached the top of the hill Aidan looked down at all the tiny people and trees so far below them. For the first time he realized just how high up they were. He felt the bottoms of his feet go sweaty and had to swallow a lump in his throat. Tara was also looking down the slope of the hill, but the glint in her eye made Aidan think that she wasn’t having any second thoughts at all. Jack was sitting on his garbage bag, with his back to the view. He was struggling to put his mitten back on, which was hard to do through three layers of puffy jacket: the material around his arms was so thick that he could barely reach one hand to the other. He looked like an extremely fat baby. An extremely fat baby who plays hockey.

Aidan walked over to help Jack, careful not to slip on the slick ice. Just as he knelt down to help, Jack finally tugged the mitten on and punched the air with satisfaction. But the quick motion was too much, and Jack began slowly sliding backwards on his bag over the crest of the hill! Aidan reached out a hand but it was too late, he could just see Jack’s surprised face disappearing down the slope at top speed!

Aidan and Tara watched Jack all the way down the steep, icy hill. It turned out that Jack was right after all: trash bags don’t steer so well.

120,10,5,"Keisha fought her way down the street through the howling wind. She kept her head bent against the pouring rain. The drawstring on the hood of her raincoat was pulled tight into a scrunchy circle around her face. Small rivers streamed over her shiny red rain boots up to the ankle. <i>There must be more water inside them than outside them at this point</i>, she thought. Below the hem of her jacket, her jeans felt heavy and suffocating. But, as she walked she felt the crisp, dry edges of the folded paper inside the waistband of her pants, and she relaxed. The letter was still dry. As long as she got out of the rain soon, there was still a chance.

She saw the entrance to the subway a block ahead of her on the left. She started to walk a bit faster. On her right she passed an old movie theatre. A large crowd of people were huddled underneath its awning staring out at her. They were silent and looked terrified to let the water touch them. Keisha waved at them, but nobody waved back. She kept walking. Two grey mice floated past her, bobbing along the street in a plastic take-out container. Finally, she reached the subway entrance.

The heavy door was in the middle of a deep puddle. Keisha had to push hard to get it to open. As the door swung open, she saw the water from the puddle go swooshing down the stairs to the platform. The wind held the door open and more water came flooding in. The stairs were now an outright waterfall, with Keisha standing boldly at its top.

All day Arachne would spin thread into yarn with a spindle. Then all night Arachne would use a loom to weave beautiful fabrics. Arachne got so good at weaving that she began to brag about her talent. She said that nobody in the whole world could weave as well as she did– not even a god. 

This angered the goddess Athena. Athena was the Greek goddess of wisdom and crafts. She did not like to hear a human claiming to be more skillful than a goddess. So, Athena challenged Arachne to a contest. They would both create a weaving. Whoever created the best weaving would win. Whoever lost would never be allowed to use a spindle or loom again! Arachne agreed and they both began weaving.

Arachne created a beautiful fabric. She used threads of every colour. It was as soft as silk and as strong as rock. But when it was Athena’s turn, she created something incredible. Athena did not use thread to weave. Instead, she used the morning sunbeams and the fluffy white clouds. She used the green of spring fields and the blue of the sky. Of course, Athena won the contest.

134,3,5,"In ancient times, there was a story about how the city of Rome was created. Most people now believe that the story was a myth. But, many ancient Romans believed that it really happened. 

The story tells of a pair of twin brothers: Remus and Romulus. The twins were the sons of King Amulius. King Amulius was the king of Alba Longa (a city near to where Rome would be). But he was afraid that his sons would try to steal his throne some day. So King Amulius threw Remus and Romulus into the river Tiber! Luckily, the twins were saved by Tiberinus, the god of the river. Tiberinus left the twins safely in a cave.

In the cave was a female wolf. But instead of attacking the children, the wolf cared for them as her own. Remus and Romulus drank the wolf’s milk. The wolf protected them as they learned and grew. When they were grown, Remus and Romulus set out to start their own city. Romulus chose the hill on which the city would stand. The city was named “Rome” in his honor. Thousands of years later, the wolf that raised Remus and Romulus is still seen as a symbol of the city. The wolf cared for the human children and gave them everything they needed– just like Rome.

177,2,6,"Did you know that the amount of water there is in the world never EVER changes? Not even by a drop, it’s true! Since the very beginning of our planet way, way, way, way, way, WAAAAY back a long time ago, we’ve had the exact same amount of water on Earth. And it has been the SAME water this whole time, just popping up in different forms! That means that the water you drink from the fountain at school could be the same water that ran through the Nile River in ancient Egypt! How is that possible, you ask? It’s all through the amazing science of the “Water Cycle”. Want to find out how it works? WATER you waiting for? Read on!

The first step in the Water Cycle is “evaporation”. Evaporation is what happens when the sun gets so hot that it heats up water all over the planet, and changes it from a liquid into steam or vapour that rises up into the air. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, rivers, ponds, puddles– even off of your own skin when you sweat! So if all that water is constantly evaporating, where does it all go? Good question!

The next step in the Water Cycle is “condensation”. Condensation is what happens when all of that steam and water vapour get together in the air and start to cool down again. When that happens, the water vapour turns back into its liquid form and becomes clouds in the sky! Have you ever seen a cloud that looked like a dragon? Or a dog? Or your Uncle Ernie with the ear hair? Well, it turns out they were all just water vapour the whole time! (Except your real Uncle Ernie, he’s a person). So now all that water is hanging out as a bunch of clouds, but how does it get back down to Earth?

RAIN! And snow! And sleet! And hail! The next step in the Water Cycle is “precipitation”, and precipitation is anything formed in clouds that falls back to Earth. Precipitation happens when so much of that water vapour gets together in one place that it becomes too heavy to keep in the clouds. Rain is water vapour falling back to Earth in its liquid form, whereas snow, hail, and sleet are all water vapour dressed up in some of its solid forms! What’s your favourite kind of precipitation? Rain is more refreshing than snow, but it’s really hard to make a rain-angel. So, is that it? Is that the final step in the cycle?

Nope– but almost! The very final step in the Water Cycle is “collection”. Collection is everything that happens to the precipitation when it actually lands back on the surface of our planet. Some precipitation falls right back into lakes and oceans and, easy-peasy, it’s ready for evaporation again. But some precipitation falls on land, and then it is collected in one of two ways: either it’s absorbed <i>into</i> the ground and becomes the water that plants drink, or it runs <i>over</i> the ground in rivers and streams until it reaches an ocean or lake once again!

So that’s it, the whole kit-and-kaboodle of the Water Cycle! It just keeps going around and around and around and around and– ok I’ll stop, I’m making myself dizzy! Now go get quenched!

199,9,6,"It is said that long, long ago, the Dwarves brewed blood and honey together to make a powerful potion they called ""Magic Mead”. Magic Mead had the power to grant wisdom and poetry to any who drank it. Hearing of its power and wanting it for himself, a Giant called Suttung stole it from the Dwarves and hid it in a cave. To protect the Magic Mead even further, Suttung put a spell on his own daughter, Gunnlod, which forced her to remain in the cave for the rest of her life and stop anyone from stealing it. 

Odin, the eldest and wisest of the Gods, also heard about the potion and set out on a quest to collect some from the Giants. He wanted to give the Magic Mead to humankind so that their words would become wise and beautiful. First, Odin disguised himself as a poor wanderer and went to the farm of Baugi, the brother of Suttung the Giant. Odin, in his disguise, offered to work Baugi’s fields in exchange for a reward. Baugi replied that it takes nine men to work his fields, and could not be done by one man alone. Odin promised he could do it, if he would be rewarded. Baugi agreed.

Using his great power and wisdom, Odin did the work of nine men in one night. The next day Baugi was pleased, and asked what the wanderer wanted as a reward. Odin replied that he wanted a drink of the Magic Mead kept by Baugi’s brother, Suttung. Baugi went to Suttung to ask for the Magic Mead, but Suttung refused.

""You cannot give away the Magic Mead!” Suttung said to Baugi. ""It is too valuable! I have trapped my daughter in a cave just to protect it! Besides, that poor wanderer seems too powerful to be who he says he is, I do not trust him.”

Baugi returned to Odin and told him that Suttung would not let him have any of the Magic Mead. Odin reminded Baugi that he owed him a reward for his work, and so Baugi must help him enter the cave and get the Magic Mead in secret. Baugi agreed and led him to the cave where the Mead was hidden.

The entrance to the cave was blocked by stones, but Baugi used his Giants’ strength to make a small hole in the rock. Suddenly, Odin transformed himself into a snake and slipped through the hole. Baugi realized he had been tricked by the poor wanderer, but it was too late.

Inside the cave Odin heard Gunnlod, Suttung’s daughter, expressing how much she wanted to be free. ""I wish I could leave this cave,” she cried, ""but the spell my father cast on me has forced me to stay here with the Magic Mead forever!”

Odin changed back into his real form and slowly approached Gunnlod. ""If you give me the Magic Mead, I will use my great powers to lift the spell your father cast and free you from this cave!” Hesitantly, Gunnlod agreed and Odin lifted the spell. Then Odin used his wisdom to lead them both out of the cave safely. Once they reached the bright world outside, Odin gave Gunnlod a sip of the Magic Mead, and they parted ways as friends.

""You cannot give away the Magic Mead!” Suttung said to Baugi. ""It is too valuable! I have trapped my daughter in a cave just to protect it! Besides, that poor wanderer seems too powerful to be who he says he is, I do not trust him.”

Baugi returned to Odin and told him that Suttung would not let him have any of the Magic Mead. Odin reminded Baugi that he owed him a reward for his work, and so Baugi must help him enter the cave and get the Magic Mead in secret. Baugi agreed and led him to the cave where the Mead was hidden.

The entrance to the cave was blocked by stones, but Baugi used his Giants’ strength to make a small hole in the rock. Suddenly, Odin transformed himself into a snake and slipped through the hole. Baugi realized he had been tricked by the poor wanderer, but it was too late.

Inside the cave Odin heard Gunnlod, Suttung’s daughter, expressing how much she wanted to be free. ""I wish I could leave this cave,” she cried, ""but the spell my father cast on me has forced me to stay here with the Magic Mead forever!”

Odin changed back into his real form and slowly approached Gunnlod. ""If you give me the Magic Mead, I will use my great powers to lift the spell your father cast and free you from this cave!” Hesitantly, Gunnlod agreed and Odin lifted the spell. Then Odin used his wisdom to lead them both out of the cave safely. Once they reached the bright world outside, Odin gave Gunnlod a sip of the Magic Mead, and they parted ways as friends. Gunnlod sang wise and beautiful words about Odin for the rest of her life.

199,9,6,"It is said that long, long ago, the Dwarves brewed blood and honey together to make a powerful potion they called ""Magic Mead”. Magic Mead had the power to grant wisdom and poetry to any who drank it. Hearing of its power and wanting it for himself, a Giant called Suttung stole it from the Dwarves and hid it in a cave. To protect the Magic Mead even further, Suttung put a spell on his own daughter, Gunnlod, which forced her to remain in the cave for the rest of her life and stop anyone from stealing it. 

Odin, the eldest and wisest of the Gods, also heard about the potion and set out on a quest to collect some from the Giants. He wanted to give the Magic Mead to humankind so that their words would become wise and beautiful. First, Odin disguised himself as a poor wanderer and went to the farm of Baugi, the brother of Suttung the Giant. Odin, in his disguise, offered to work Baugi’s fields in exchange for a reward. Baugi replied that it takes nine men to work his fields, and could not be done by one man alone. Odin promised he could do it, if he would be rewarded. Baugi agreed.

British dogs were also eager to do their part. Dogs were trained to spot far-off enemies and send messages from base to base. Soldiers slipped notes into tubes on their collars and the dogs ran back and forth delivering them. The dogs were fast and difficult to catch. Plus, they chased the rats out of the trenches!

Pigeons helped to send messages over even longer distances! They were trained to fly from Britain to the battlefields and back again. This allowed news to travel quickly both ways. The pigeons were so good at this job that the Germans even trained hawks to attack them in flight!

The shortcake was so sensationally special because every year Uncle Ali baked it to be the exact same height as Ibrahim! The cake would have layers and layers of biscuit, whipped cream, and strawberries piled up to the very tip top of the birthday boy’s head!

When Ibrahim was just a little tiny baby, the shortcake was only two layers tall. Ibrahim’s mother sat him down on the counter beside the cake and Ibrahim tried to give it a hug.

A few birthdays later, Ibrahim had grown up to six years old and the shortcake had grown up to three and a half feet tall! Uncle Ali had to bake seven whole layers and hung a sign on it that said ""Must be this tall to ride”.

But then Ibrahim really hit his growth spurt. He grew to six feet tall, and then to seven, and then to eight feet tall and there was no sign of him slowing down!

By the time Ibrahim turned sixteen, he was thirty feet tall! Ibrahim was taller than his mom and his dad and the oak tree in their yard. He was so tall that he couldn’t fit inside the house anymore!

He would be lying still in his soft bed, when suddenly the loud <i>CLANG</i> of metal on metal would make his eyelids shoot open in a jolt. Then came the sounds of digging. The soft shuffle and hiss of dirt being spilled over dirt, again and again.

The first time it had happened, Mustafa woke up confused and on edge in the dark. Once he realized that he had just been startled out of a dream, he relaxed a little and rolled over, ready to go back to sleep. But then he heard the digging coming from outside his window. 

Mustafa’s bedroom was on the first floor of their apartment building, and its window faced out into a beautiful gated courtyard. All the other apartment buildings looked into that courtyard and it was filled with trees, and flower beds, and wooden benches. During the daytime, the courtyard would be filled with little kids running around, and older folks sitting in the shade to read. But at night it was filled with nothing but shadows, and the tall black metal gates that surrounded it were firmly shut, chained, and locked.

At first Mustafa just lay there on his side, gazing out of his window, listening. He had never heard more than the mewling of a cat in the courtyard at night, and this was definitely no cat. From where he lay, he could just see the sharp pointed black tips of the gate glinting in the silvery moonlight, and all of the dark, dark night sky beyond. The sound of the digging continued steadily: a jab, a muffled patter of dirt, a low whispering sound as it scattered and slid.

Mustafa knew Joseph, the man who tended the trees and gardens in the courtyard. He knew that Joseph obsessed over his gardens, and only ever dug in them during the day because he believed that plants liked peace at nighttime, just like people. He also knew that Joseph was the only person with the keys to the courtyard gate. So, who was this digging in the courtyard in the middle of the night? And what were they digging for?

Mustafa no longer felt like going back to sleep. He didn’t think he could have if he tried. His heart was starting to beat a little louder in his chest, and he noticed that the hand gripping his blanket was sweaty. Slowly, he pulled the blankets back and slid out of his bed. He crawled across the floor to the window, not wanting his head to be seen. He paused just below it and crouched, listening.

<i>Jab, patter, whisper; jab, patter, whisper</i>– was it getting faster? Mustafa took a deep breath, held it, and inched his head up to peer through the bottom of the window. 

Fifteen feet from where Mustafa knelt, through the gate and across the grass was a large pit in the ground. Mounds of black earth were piled all around it, and a vivid orange glow was coming from its unseen depths. Closest to Mustafa were a couple of objects covered in dirt. The first was a large tattered book, leather-bound, but too filthy to read the title of. The other was a headdress of some kind, or a crown. Its metal was carved with detailed markings and it had jewels or stones embedded all across its surface. As Mustafa stared out at it, his widening eyes reflecting both the pale moon and the strange orange light, he finally let out his breath in a gasp as he realized: set into the crown were not jewels, or stones, but hundreds and hundreds of human teeth.

Suddenly a slow creaking sound rose up from the bottom of the pit and Mustafa ran back to his bed and jumped under the covers. Turning his back to the window he tried to steady his breath which was coming hard and fast. He tried closing his eyes, willing himself to go back to sleep and awake to find this had all been a terrible dream, but every time his eyelids closed the image of the crown was there waiting for him. Even under the blankets on that warm night, Mustafa lay there shivering for a long time before he finally fell asleep.

The next morning Mustafa rose slowly, sitting up and letting the smoky scent of bacon wash over him pleasantly before even opening his eyes. Once they were open, he blinked dully at a shadow on his wall, a shadow cast by the pointed tips of the metal courtyard gate.

And suddenly, with a feeling like an icy stone falling into his stomach, he remembered. Nearly tripping over his own feet in his hurry to reach the window, when he got there he breathed a deep shuddering sigh of relief. He even let out a little laugh. 

Looking out into the sunny courtyard, everything was just as it should be. A man with a coffee cup was on a bench reading a magazine. A woman and her small daughter were having a tickle fight under a large oak tree. No pit. No orange light. No crown. 

<i>What a terrifying dream that was! </i>Mustafa thought to himself. <i>I’ve really gotta cool it on those late-night movies Mom hates. Maybe there is such a thing as too-vivid an imagination.</i>

And he went to go have breakfast with his family.

That night Mustafa yawned and leaned back into his pillows, already wondering what his dad might be making for breakfast the next day when he gently drifted off to sleep. 

Then he heard a <i>CLANG</i>, followed by the unmistakable sounds of digging.

He would be lying still in his soft bed, when suddenly the loud <i>CLANG</i> of metal on metal would make his eyelids shoot open in a jolt. Then came the sounds of digging. The soft shuffle and hiss of dirt being spilled over dirt, again and again.

The first time it had happened, Mustafa woke up confused and on edge in the dark. Once he realized that he had just been startled out of a dream, he relaxed a little and rolled over, ready to go back to sleep. But then he heard the digging coming from outside his window. 

Mustafa’s bedroom was on the first floor of their apartment building, and its window faced out into a beautiful gated courtyard.

237,3,8,"Trung Trac and Trung Nhi were two sisters who lived in Vietnam from AD 12- AD 43. They grew up in a small rural village in what would now be Northern Vietnam. They lived in an area called Giao Chi, which was ruled by China (and the Han Dynasty) at that time. The sisters were well-trained in martial arts from a young age because of their father’s position in government. 

As time went on, the relationship between the Vietnamese people and their Chinese rulers got worse. The Vietnamese felt that their people and culture were being attacked and cruelly mistreated. The Chinese were also trying to expand farther into Vietnam to control more of the South. Eventually, Trung Trac’s husband, Thi Sach, tried to stand up to the Chinese rulers and rebel. Unfortunately, his plan failed. The Chinese executed him as a warning to others not to try the same thing.

However, the murder of her husband inspired Trung Trac and her younger sister to do just that: they began to plot rebellion against the Chinese. In AD 40, the Trung Sisters were able to fight a small Chinese unit out of their own village. With the confidence and respect they earned from that, they began to build a large army of 80 000 people– mostly made up of other women (including their own mother)! During this time in ancient Vietnam it was very unusual for women to be warriors, and many people thought it was wrong for these women to be fighting. But the Trung Sisters didn’t care, and within a few months their army of women (riding on a herd of elephants!) had taken back 65 cities from the Chinese! They won freedom for the ancient kingdom of Nanyue, and both became its ruling queens! 

They successfully protected Nanyue from Chinese attacks for the next three years, until they were killed in battle in AD 43. Nobody knows exactly how the sisters died. Some records say that they fell at the hand of a powerful Chinese general, Ma Yuan. Another story says that the Trung Sisters were defeated when their male attackers tried fighting naked, and the mostly female army ran away out of embarrassment (but this is almost certainly just a story). Other records say that the sisters vanished into the sky, or threw themselves into a river and became stone statues.

No matter what happened to them in the end, the Trung Sisters are admired for leading the first resistance movement in Vietnam after 247 years of being ruled by China. Many temples have been built to honor the Trung sisters and there is an annual holiday in Vietnam to celebrate their story.

241,8,8,"Now that Clara had narrowed down her list of suspects to three people, she was sure that she’d be able to figure out who had stolen the nose from the famous Nosy General statue. As soon as the museum staff realized what had happened, they sealed off the scene of the crime with her entire class inside it. That’s how Clara knew that the guilty person– and the nose– must still be right there in the room with them. The statue's  stone nose might be missing, but Clara was determined to sniff out the thief!

Clara’s first suspect was Drew Doodleson, but Clara wasn’t certain that Drew could have taken the nose even if he had wanted to. He was so allergic to the polish they used on all the statues in the museum that his nose had been running all day! Anyway, he was still on Clara’s suspect list because besides his allergies, he had another nose problem on his hands: Drew could draw almost anything, but he always said that noses were the hardest. Lately he had been complaining that none of his family members would sit still long enough for him to get the noses right in their portraits.

Suspect number two was none other than the dreaded Ms. Snootle! Ms. Snootle was their school’s vice-principal (and happened to be Clara’s least favourite grown-up in the world), but that was NOT why she was a suspect. When the class had first entered this room on the museum tour to see the statue, Ms. Snootle had been deeply offended that they could see up the Nosy General's nostrils. Clara and the other kids had tried to explain to her that here in the museum, nostrils were ""art”, but Snootle wouldn’t listen. Instead, Ms. Snootle simply turned her big grey bushy head away from the statue to shield her eyes, and began yelling at the tour guide about ""the importance of modesty in this day and age!” 

The final suspect was Annie ""The Android” Anderson. Annie loved robotics and was always tinkering with some gizmo or gadget. Lately she had been bragging about the life-size robot she was building that was going to help her get double servings of dessert from the cafeteria at lunchtimes. Apparently, the only problem with it was that she hadn’t been able to make the robot’s face look exactly human yet, since all it had were bottle caps for eyes, a tube of lipstick for a nose, and an old pencil case as a mouth. And Annie had told Clara just that morning about how her mom was starting to wonder where her favourite lipstick had gotten to.

As Clara weighed the clues and motives in her head, a member of the museum staff asked everyone to check inside their bags and pockets for the nose. As everybody stuck their heads inside their backpacks and coats, Clara heard a muffled sneeze, and that’s when she knew that she’d caught the culprit!

242,3,8,"Between 37 AD and 41 AD, ancient Rome had an emperor named Caligula, and Caligula had a pet horse. Caligula was not the world’s most popular leader, so a lot of people made up stories about him to make him look bad, or silly, or crazy. Since Caligula lived such a long time ago, it’s hard for historians to know exactly which of these stories are true, and which ones were made up or exaggerated. But we do know that of all the horses Caligula had (which was a lot!), he had a favourite: Incitatus. In Latin, ""incitatus” means ""swift” or ""fast”, and Caligula thought Incitatus was the coolest, fastest, most beautiful horse in all the land!

But some stories say that Caligula’s love for Incitatus went even farther than that! Some stories say that Caligula gave Incitatus a stable made of marble and a feeding trough made of ivory! They say that Caligula clothed his horse in the expensive and rare purple blankets that were meant only for royalty, and that he ordered REAL GOLD to be mixed in with Incitatus’ oats! Some records even say that Caligula had a special collar made for Incitatus that was covered in shiny precious stones.

But the craziest story of all is that Caligula was planning on putting Incitatus in government! According to the legend, Caligula wanted to make Incitatus a ""consul” which was a very important and high-ranking elected position in the Roman government, sort of like a senator. (I guess if the horse disagreed with any laws being passed, he could just shout out ""Neigh”!) Caligula even ordered that a large house would be built and filled with servants so that Incitatus could greet and entertain visiting politicians and royalty from other lands! Some people say that Caligula wanted to make Incitatus a consul as an insult to the other senators (""your job is so easy my horse could do it!”). Other people think that Caligula was just a crazy guy with a thing for horses. But, whether Caligula was serious or just horsin’ around, it is clear that Incitatus was a horse for the ages!

The mountain saw everything that the sun could touch. It knew the great forest to the north. It knew the wild jungle to the east. It knew the wide plains to the west. It knew the shining sea to the south. It stood there proudly for years and years and years. 

But age wore the mountain down. In time the tall mountain was no more than a hill. Grass settled on its rounded top. A little town grew up on its side. The hill saw everything for miles around. It knew the animals that walked the land. It knew the birds that flew in the sky. It knew the people who worked and danced. It knew the mood of every season. It stood there proudly for years and years and years. 

But age wore the hill down. In time the round hill was no more than a boulder. Scratches marked its hard faces. It sat on the edge of that little town. But the little town had grown into a big town. The boulder saw everything that happened in town. It knew the lights of the pub and the shops. It knew the carts that rolled through the streets. It knew the children that played in the alleys. It knew the cats that walked along the fences. It stood there proudly for years and years and years.

But age wore the boulder down. In time the large boulder was no more than a rock. The rock was no bigger than a basketball. It sat below a great leafy tree in a park in the middle of town. But the big town had grown into a big city. The rock saw everything about the tree. It knew the shape of each different leaf. It knew the birds in every nest. It knew each nook of the tree’s bumpy bark. It knew the twists of the tree’s many roots. It sat there proudly for years and years and years.

But age wore the rock down. In time the small rock was no more than a pebble. It was very smooth and very small. It had been kicked and rolled all through the city. Until one day it landed on the edge of a beach. The pebble looked out at the shining ocean. It remembered when it had reached higher than the clouds. It remembered every season it had seen. It remembered every person and every animal it had known. It remembered the land before this city. The pebble was proud of the things that it knew.

Queen Dreck had the magic crown. Whoever had the magic crown got to rule the kingdom. Nobody knew how she got it. Some people think that she stole it from the last Queen’s daughter. Others think that she stole the daughter’s whole head! However she got it, she wasn’t ever going to give it up. Many people had tried to take it from her. Everybody had failed.

Queen Dreck was as sneaky as she was evil. She was good at keeping the magic crown safe. She walked everywhere with strong armed guards. The castle was protected by a moat of flame. When she slept, she held the crown to her chest. She always slept lightly, ready to attack any thieves. That was bad news for thieves, because Queen Dreck was a master of karate.

Queen Dreck was sneaky, but Wigaldo the Wizard was smarter. Wigaldo lived in the castle too. The Queen used him to make poisons for her enemies. But Wigaldo was done with all that now. He only had one last poison to make. And it was for Queen Dreck! Wigaldo crafted a poison that would put the queen in a deep deep sleep. Then he could snatch the crown! 

He made the poison and mixed it into a pot of tea. Just as he was about to leave with it, he had an idea. With one small fix, his plan was ready. He took the tea to Queen Dreck’s bedroom.

“Your Majesty, Queen Dreck, I have your bedtime tea,” he said.

“I see,” said Queen Dreck, raising her eyebrows. “But why have you made it for me, Wigaldo? I usually make the blind maid do it. I like to see her spill the hot tea on herself as she tries to climb the stairs.”

“I was in the kitchen when it was ready, Your Majesty,” Wigaldo said, thinking quickly. “It was my honor to bring it here to you.”

“I see,” Queen Dreck said again. “This isn’t a trick, is it, Wigaldo? I hate tricks. Unless they’re mine. I think you should drink the tea first. Just to make sure there is nothing wrong with it. You wouldn’t want anything bad to happen to your Queen. Would you?”

“Of course not, Queen Dreck,” Wigaldo said. He poured himself a cup of tea. He took a deep breath. And he drank. 

But what Queen Dreck didn’t know, was that none of the tea was reaching Wigaldo’s throat! Clever Wigaldo had tied a small sack to a tooth. It was now sitting empty inside of his cheek. As he poured the tea into his mouth, it only filled up the sack!

Wigaldo put down the empty cup and licked his lips. “Are you ready for your tea now, my Queen?” he said.

Queen Dreck frowned. “Yes, Wigaldo,” she said. “I would have liked to see something bad happen to you. But I will have my tea instead.”

So Wigaldo poured a nice full cup of tea for the queen. She drank it down in one big gulp! A moment later, she was fast asleep. Wigaldo snatched the magic crown from her head. Queen Dreck didn’t stir. Wigaldo ran from the room and into the streets. He waved the crown high above his own bald head as he ran.

“We are free! We are free!” he cried with joy to the cheering crowd. And they were.

315,8,3,"Ravi was in the school library. He walked slowly down the narrow path between two tall shelves. He ran his finger along the dusty spines of books. He was looking for a mystery novel he hadn’t read yet. Ravi liked the detective stories best. Finally he spotted one he didn’t know. The spine was fat and blue. It’s title read: THE MISSING MAMMOTH MYSTERY. Ravi pulled it out from the shelf. But through the gap between the books, he saw something strange! A wide blue eye watching him from the next row over! The eye blinked once, and disappeared. Whoever had been watching him was on the run!

Ravi ran to the end of his row. He made a sharp right turn. He heard carpet muffled footsteps fading away. But by the time he turned to look, it was too late. Ravi saw the end of a red ponytail whip around the far corner. He knew that by the time he got there, they’d be gone. At least now he knew that whoever it was had blue eyes, and long red hair. He took out his notebook and wrote that down.

Then Ravi walked back to the mystery section. He had dropped his new book in the heat of the chase. But who would want to spy on him? And why would they be so afraid of being found out? Ravi had no idea. It was all very strange. 

Ravi returned to the row he had been standing in before. He found his poor book lying there on the floor. He picked it up and walked over to a row of plump armchairs. Then he sat down to read. He opened it up to the very first page. But then he heard something behind him. It was somebody breathing! Somebody was standing right behind him! 

But Ravi didn’t move. He played it cool. Slowly, he pulled a small mirror out of his pocket. He always kept one in there for moments like these. He held the mirror against the book’s inside pages. Then he raised the book up in front of him like he was reading. Finally he could see behind him in the reflection. It was one of those spinning metal bookshelves. It was full of brightly colored books of all kinds. He couldn’t see anyone there at all! But then he saw something right at the bottom of the shelf. A pair of purple sneakers!

Ravi jumped up out of his chair! He wanted to catch this spy in the act! 

“Gotcha!” he cried, twisting in the air. But he was only met with a quiet squeaking. The metal bookshelf was spinning around and around. The purple sneakers were gone.

Now Ravi was really curious. He had to know who this spy was. He had to find out who had sent them. So Ravi went into full detective mode. From the direction the shelf was spinning, he guessed which way the spy had gone. He turned up his shirt collar to hide his face. He walked on his tip-toes for ultra quiet sneaking. He hid behind book displays. He hid behind teachers. Finally he reached the other side of the library.

And there behind a door he saw them! The purple sneakers! Ravi ran over and pulled the door open. A girl in a trenchcoat was standing there. She had purple sneakers and red hair tied in a ponytail. Ravi knew her eyes were blue, but he couldn’t see them behind her dark sunglasses. 

“Oh all right!” she yelled at him. “What do you want? Why are you spying on me?” The nearby librarian shushed her.

Ravi couldn’t believe it. Him spying on her? No way! “What do you mean?” Ravi yelled back. “I wasn’t spying on you! You were spying on me!” The librarian shushed them again.

“But you just snuck over here like a sneaky spy!” She whispered this time. 

“That’s because I thought you were sneaking up on me!” he whispered back.

“Oh. Pretty good sneaking. I’m Mabel.” she said. She stuck her hand out at Ravi.

“You’re pretty good too,” he said. He shook her hand. “I’m Ravi.”

“Hey,” Mabel said. “Have you ever thought about being in a detective duo?”

“Only all the time!” Ravi replied. “Let’s do it!”

Ravi and Mabel high-fived. It made a loud and satisfying SMACK! They both grinned as the librarian kicked them out of the library.

316,10,3,"“Please just get it out of here,” Wyatt’s dad called from the bathroom. “You know the rules. Nothing with more than four legs in the apartment.”

“Fine,” Wyatt huffed. “But I don’t get why it’s always my job. You trapped the thing! How come I have to take it out?”

“It’s about being a team player, hon,” came his dad’s reply. Wyatt could hear him washing his hands again. “Molly found it in the sink. And she, uh, raised the alarm.” Wyatt could still hear her sobbing in the next room. “I chased it around and trapped it. It almost took some of me with it, too. Now you just have to bring it downstairs and set it free. Everyone does their part.”

“Ugh, fine. Here I go!” Wyatt called. “But if I’m not back in five minutes, call the fire department. Tell them it ate me alive! On your orders!”

Wyatt kneeled down. He lowered his face to the level of the glass. Trapped inside was a big, disgusting centipede. It was crawling all over. Its creepy little legs were wiggling like crazy. 

“Gross,” said Wyatt. Then he took a deep breath.

Wyatt slid a take-out menu under the glass. He was careful not to leave room for the bug to crawl out. Then he picked up the glass– menu, bug, and all. Holding it at arm’s length, he walked out the front door.

Wyatt’s family lived in an apartment building. All the windows had screens on them. And they lived on the 11th floor. That meant that Wyatt had to bring the bug all the way down to the lobby just to let it out. Wyatt reached the elevators.

He had one hand on the menu under the cup. His other hand was planted firmly on top of the cup. He was NOT going to let that thing get out until they were outside. But it left him no hands for the elevator button. He crouched down and pressed it with his elbow.

“You’re just lucky you didn’t end up in a bug-crushing household,” Wyatt told the bug. “My dad doesn’t like to kill things. Even gross-out things like you. I guess I don’t either. But I don’t like being your personal driver much better.”

The elevator dinged and Wyatt got in. Using his elbow again, he pushed the button for “lobby”. He looked into the cup. The centipede was racing around inside. It crawled up the sides and back down again. It ran around and around. 

“Wow, you’re fast!” Wyatt said. “You must be pretty scared, huh? I would be pretty scared if I was you. Some weird looking giant traps me in a tank and runs off with me? Yeah I’d say that’s nightmare fuel for sure.”

Wyatt watched the floor numbers light up as the elevator went down. 9...8...7. He looked into the cup again. He brought it a little closer to his face. The centipede had stopped running. It was standing on the side of the glass. Its long skinny antenna waved slowly back and forth.

Wyatt laughed. “It looks like you’re waving at me!” he said. “Helloooo in there!” Wyatt tilted the glass a little. The centipede didn’t move. “It’s cool that you can crawl up walls,” he said. “I wish I could do that. Then you could see the whole world upside down! With that plus your speed, you’d make a good superhero. We could call you Captain Critter!”

The elevator rumbled down a few more floors. 4...3...2. Wyatt had a strange feeling. He was almost at the lobby. He was almost done with this gross, icky job. But he felt sad. He didn’t want to lose Captain Critter. 

The elevator dinged again. The doors slid open. They had reached the lobby. Wyatt could see the big glass doors to the street. But he didn’t step out. 

No, Wyatt crouched again and pushed the number 11 button with his elbow. The doors slid shut. Wyatt looked at Captain Critter and smiled. His dad was not going to be happy about his new pet.

317,10,3,"It was the last few minutes of the last soccer game of the season. The finals.  Whoever won this game, won it all. And Miranda wanted to win more than anything.

The sky was a clear, cloudless blue. The late afternoon sun was bright and golden. Miranda could see it glinting off the table of trophies. Parents, siblings, and kids from other teams lined one side of the field. Some were sitting in the grass. Some were munching hot dogs. But all eyes were on the game. The score was 1-1, with just 3 minutes to go.

Miranda looked out at her teammates. Every member of the Panthers wore a royal blue jersey. Each one had their number on the back. They were scattered across the field, but they flowed together like water. They ran in almost perfect step. They passed the ball like they were mind-readers. They had practiced and practiced for this. And they were good. Really good. But there was a problem.

For every royal blue jersey, there was an orange jersey to match. The Rockets. They weren't a very good team. But they played rough. That was the problem. The girls on the Rockets had a bad habit. They liked to foul players when the ref wasn’t looking. Their coach never seemed to be looking either. And when they did get called, they were suddenly all smiles and pigtails. But what did grown ups know about what happened on the field, anyway? On the field it was kids vs. kids. The rest was just details. 

And now they had reached the final game. The game they had been working for all season. They had to win. 

Miranda saw the ball come sailing towards her. She ran and met it as it landed. She ran faster, tapping the ball along with her. She was almost at the Panther’s net! But just then a defender popped up in front of her. The girl was like a human wall. Miranda couldn't get past her. She looked around quickly. Her teammate Vanessa was on her left! She passed the ball to Vanessa and Vanessa took the shot! The ball soared towards the net. But the goalie’s hands were too quick! The goalie punched the ball away. It flew off behind the goal post. 

The whistle blew. Corner kick for the Panthers. Miranda checked her watch. Just one minute left in the game. This was going to be their last chance. Kaitlyn went to take the corner. Kaitlyn had a kick so powerful that she had dented a parking sign once! Almost every member of the Panthers crushed in around the net. It was all a jumble of blue and orange. The whistle blew again. Kaitlyn took the kick.

With a powerful THWACK the ball spun high in the air! It arched over the first few players. Miranda watched it like it was happening in slow motion. She saw the ball starting to drop towards her. She saw the goalie drifting towards the left side of the net. She felt a Rockets player tugging on her jersey. She jumped up and headed the ball! The Rockets goalie reached for it, but it was no use. The ball plunged deep into the right side of the net! 

Nobody heard the final whistle over the screams of joy from the team and the crowd. Everyone rushed the field! They had done it! They had won!

He lived at home with his mom and dad.

He tried to be good, and not to be bad.



Mom and Dad worked in the big city, 

where thousands of glass windows shined, oh so pretty!

Casey stayed home and played all day long,

hiding in laundry, and barking dog songs.



Mom said, ""Remember, be a good boy today!”

Casey looked up at her, and with a bark said, ""Okay!”

Dad said, ""Here is a nice new bone to chew!

When Jeremy was very young, his mother had taught him to say, <i>“Star-light, star-bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight.”</i> But whenever he gazed up at the night sky, even if he concentrated with with all his might, he couldn’t see a single star.

Jeremy’s mother explained that the lights of the city are so bright that the stars fade into the background, and become very difficult to see. “But then how do kids in the city make wishes?” Jeremy asked. His mother thought about it for a while, and then said, “You just have to be a little more creative.”

After that, Jeremy began finding stars all over the place. But instead of looking up, towards the empty night sky, he gazed down at the city, through his twenty-third floor window. The city, he found, was actually full of stars, after all. You just have to be a little more creative.

Jeremy made wishes on the blinking lights of airplanes, and on the blinking lights on the tops of tall buildings. He made wishes on the headlights of cars on the freeway (although these were more like shooting stars). And he made wishes on the lights of the city streets, on windy nights, when the treetops danced with the lampposts far below his twenty-third floor window.

Jeremy decided that he was actually pretty lucky to live in the city. “The city is so big and the sky is so small,” he thought to himself. For the little patch of sky that he could see between the tall buildings looked no bigger than a postage stamp. Jeremy figured that there were definitely more stars in the city than you could possibly fit into that tiny patch of sky.

Then, one day, Jeremy’s mother announced that his family was going on a camping trip in the country. Jeremy didn’t like the sound of that idea one bit. He had lived in the city his whole life, and had never been to the country. He didn’t want to leave his twenty-third floor apartment, and all of the twinkling stars of the city.

But, no matter how much he whined, and no matter how much he begged, his mother would not listen. “You’ve never been to the country,” she said. “How do you know you’re not going to like it?” But Jeremy was sure that there was nothing in the country that he would like more than the city.

The next day, they packed up the car and drove off to the country. Jeremy sat in the back seat with his arms crossed and sulked the whole way. They passed lots of trees and farms, and more trees and more farms, and the occasional house along the road.

One farm that they passed had a bunch of cows standing in a field. Jeremy’s mom said, “Hey look! Cows! You’ve never seen cows before, have you?” But Jeremy just continued to sulk. “Big deal,” he said. “You can see cows anytime on milk cartons.”

Another farm had horses, and his mom said, “Hey look, Jeremy! Horses! You’ve never seen those before either!” But Jeremy continued to sulk. “So what,” he said. “You can see horses anytime on TV.”

Finally, they arrived at their campsite and unpacked their things. Jeremy tried to set up his tent but it just turned into a big mess. The sheet got all tangled, the poles wouldn’t fit, and Jeremy got frustrated and sulked <i>even more</i>.

Then, they went for a walk in the woods and Jeremy got bitten by every mosquito. The bites left itchy red bumps all over his body, which his mother told him not to scratch. And Jeremy got frustrated and sulked <i>even more</i>.

Then, it started to rain and their clothing got soaked. They ran back to camp and put on dry things. But Jeremy still felt damp and uncomfortable. He was now very frustrated and sulked <i>even more!</i>

For dinner, they just had cooked hot dogs on sticks and baked potatoes wrapped in tin foil. Jeremy’s mom said, “It’s fun to cook on an open fire!” But Jeremy didn’t think that it was fun at all.

He was cold, and he was itchy, and very, <i>very</i> frustrated! Jeremy stood up and yelled at his mom, “I hate the country! I just want to go home!” Then he turned away from the campfire and stomped back toward his tent.

But away from the campfire, it was very dark, and Jeremy couldn’t see where he was going. His foot slipped on a patch of fresh mud and Jeremy fell straight backwards onto the cold, wet ground.

This should have made Jeremy even more frustrated – and it would have – <i>except</i> that at that very moment, when Jeremy opened his eyes, something amazing happened.

For the first time, when Jeremy looked up at the night sky, he could see stars, as far as the eye could see. And not just a few stars either. Hundreds of stars! Thousands of stars! Millions of stars! Zillions of stars! More stars than you could possibly imagine. “All of the lights in all the cities of the world would not be enough to fill a sky so big,” thought Jeremy. “It would take you a hundred lifetimes to wish on all of those stars!”

Then, Jeremy closed his eyes and concentrated with all his might on a very important wish. He looked up at the stars, twinkling above, and said, <i>“Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish, I wish tonight…”</i>

Afterwards, he continued to lie there, gazing up at the sky for several minutes. Finally, his mother called him from the campfire saying, “Jeremy, are you alright?”

“I’m fine,” said Jeremy with a smile on his face. Maybe the country wasn’t so bad after all.

A few days later, Jeremy’s family packed up their bags and drove back to the city.

That night, Jeremy looked out of his twenty-third floor window, as usual. But, instead of looking down at the lights of the city below, he looked up at the patch of night sky above him. A big grin appeared on Jeremy’s face when he saw that his wish had actually come true.

For there, in that small patch of sky, he could see a single star twinkling away. And when Jeremy saw it, he remembered that somewhere, way up high, above the tall buildings around him, there was a giant sky full of twinkling stars. And they were shining brighter than the lights of any city.

When Jeremy was very young, his mother had taught him to say, <i>“Star-light, star-bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight.”</i> But whenever he gazed up at the night sky, even if he concentrated with with all his might, he couldn’t see a single star.

Jeremy’s mother explained that the lights of the city are so bright that the stars fade into the background, and become very difficult to see. “But then how do kids in the city make wishes?” Jeremy asked. His mother thought about it for a while, and then said, “You just have to be a little more creative.”

After that, Jeremy began finding stars all over the place. But instead of looking up, towards the empty night sky, he gazed down at the city, through his twenty-third floor window. The city, he found, was actually full of stars, after all. You just have to be a little more creative.

Jeremy made wishes on the blinking lights of airplanes, and on the blinking lights on the tops of tall buildings. He made wishes on the headlights of cars on the freeway (although these were more like shooting stars). And he made wishes on the lights of the city streets, on windy nights, when the treetops danced with the lampposts far below his twenty-third floor window.

Jeremy decided that he was actually pretty lucky to live in the city. “The city is so big and the sky is so small,” he thought to himself. For the little patch of sky that he could see between the tall buildings looked no bigger than a postage stamp. Jeremy figured that there were definitely more stars in the city than you could possibly fit into that tiny patch of sky.

Then, one day, Jeremy’s mother announced that his family was going on a camping trip in the country. Jeremy didn’t like the sound of that idea one bit. He had lived in the city his whole life, and had never been to the country. He didn’t want to leave his twenty-third floor apartment, and all of the twinkling stars of the city.

But, no matter how much he whined, and no matter how much he begged, his mother would not listen. “You’ve never been to the country,” she said. “How do you know you’re not going to like it?” But Jeremy was sure that there was nothing in the country that he would like more than the city.

The next day, they packed up the car and drove off to the country. Jeremy sat in the back seat with his arms crossed and sulked the whole way. They passed lots of trees and farms, and more trees and more farms, and the occasional house along the road.

One farm that they passed had a bunch of cows standing in a field. Jeremy’s mom said, “Hey look! Cows! You’ve never seen cows before, have you?” But Jeremy just continued to sulk. “Big deal,” he said. “You can see cows anytime on milk cartons.”

Another farm had horses, and his mom said, “Hey look, Jeremy! Horses! You’ve never seen those before either!” But Jeremy continued to sulk. “So what,” he said. “You can see horses anytime on TV.”

Finally, they arrived at their campsite and unpacked their things. Jeremy tried to set up his tent but it just turned into a big mess. The sheet got all tangled, the poles wouldn’t fit, and Jeremy got frustrated and sulked <i>even more</i>.

Then, they went for a walk in the woods and Jeremy got bitten by every mosquito. The bites left itchy red bumps all over his body, which his mother told him not to scratch. And Jeremy got frustrated and sulked <i>even more</i>.

Then, it started to rain and their clothing got soaked. They ran back to camp and put on dry things. But Jeremy still felt damp and uncomfortable. He was now very frustrated and sulked <i>even more!</i>

For dinner, they just had cooked hot dogs on sticks and baked potatoes wrapped in tin foil. Jeremy’s mom said, “It’s fun to cook on an open fire!” But Jeremy didn’t think that it was fun at all.

He was cold, and he was itchy, and very, <i>very</i> frustrated! Jeremy stood up and yelled at his mom, “I hate the country! I just want to go home!” Then he turned away from the campfire and stomped back toward his tent.

But away from the campfire, it was very dark, and Jeremy couldn’t see where he was going. His foot slipped on a patch of fresh mud and Jeremy fell straight backwards onto the cold, wet ground.

This should have made Jeremy even more frustrated – and it would have – <i>except</i> that at that very moment, when Jeremy opened his eyes, something amazing happened.

For the first time, when Jeremy looked up at the night sky, he could see stars, as far as the eye could see. And not just a few stars either. Hundreds of stars! Thousands of stars! Millions of stars! Zillions of stars! More stars than you could possibly imagine. “All of the lights in all the cities of the world would not be enough to fill a sky so big,” thought Jeremy. “It would take you a hundred lifetimes to wish on all of those stars!”

Then, Jeremy closed his eyes and concentrated with all his might on a very important wish. He looked up at the stars, twinkling above, and said, <i>“Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish, I wish tonight…”</i>

Afterwards, he continued to lie there, gazing up at the sky for several minutes. Finally, his mother called him from the campfire saying, “Jeremy, are you alright?”

“I’m fine,” said Jeremy with a smile on his face. Maybe the country wasn’t so bad after all.

A few days later, Jeremy’s family packed up their bags and drove back to the city.

That night, Jeremy looked out of his twenty-third floor window, as usual. But, instead of looking down at the lights of the city below, he looked up at the patch of night sky above him. A big grin appeared on Jeremy’s face when he saw that his wish had actually come true.

For there, in that small patch of sky, he could see a single star twinkling away. And when Jeremy saw it, he remembered that somewhere, way up high, above the tall buildings around him, there was a giant sky full of twinkling stars. And they were shining brighter than the lights of any city.

I have a pet stick. I named him Henry. He is longer than my arm, and as thick as my thumb. He has a green mark on him that looks like the letter H. That’s why I named him Henry. Henry likes to go places with me.

""Henry, where do you want to go today?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go to the playground,” I say.

We go to the playground. Henry goes down the big slide with me. I hold him high in the air as we slide down fast.

""Henry, where do you want to go next?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go play in the sandbox,” I say.

Henry helps me dig in the sandbox. He digs better than a shovel. We dig a big hole around our castle.

""Henry, where do you want to go next?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go play soccer,” I say.

We practice kicking the soccer ball in the goal. I get many goals. Henry tries, but can’t kick the ball very far.

""Henry, where do you want to go next?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go play fetch with Daisy,” I say.

My dog’s name is Daisy. She loves when I throw things in the yard. I yell ""Fetch!” and she brings them back to me.

I wait for Daisy to get ready. I know that she’s ready when she barks.

Daisy barks, ""Woof!” I throw Henry as far as I can.

""Fetch!” I yell.

Daisy runs to Henry and picks him up in her mouth. Daisy runs back to me.

""Good girl,” I say. 

I pet Daisy on her head. Daisy has brown fur and it feels soft in my hands. She likes it when I pet her.

Henry is wet from being in Daisy’s mouth. I wipe him off on my shorts.

""Henry, do you want to keep playing?”

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s do it again.”

I pull my arm back and throw Henry even farther this time. Henry goes so far he lands in the woods. Daisy runs after Henry, but doesn’t come back.

""Daisy!” I yell.

Daisy is still in the woods.

""Daisy!” I yell again.

Daisy still hasn’t come out of the woods.

I run to the woods. I see Daisy. She is looking for Henry, but she can’t find him. I look at the ground. Now I know why Daisy can’t find Henry. There are hundreds of sticks in the woods and they all look the same!

I pick up many sticks and look at each one carefully. None of them is Henry. None of them is longer than my arm, and as thick as my thumb. None of them has a green mark that looks like the letter H. Henry is lost in the woods. 

Daisy brings me many sticks, too, but none of them is Henry. I sit down on a log and start to cry. Daisy comes over to me and licks my fingers. She sometimes does that when I’m sad.

No more riding on the slide with Henry. No more digging in the sand with Henry. No more playing soccer with Henry. No more playing fetch with Henry. I wipe my tears on my shirt sleeve.

""C’mon, Daisy. Let’s go inside.”

I stand up and walk back towards my house. Daisy follows me. 

That’s when I trip on a root. I land in a pile of even more leaves. As I get up, that’s when I see him.

""Henry!”

Henry was hiding under the pile of leaves, and I fell right next to him. He is longer than my arm, and as thick as my thumb. He has a green mark that looks like the letter H. Yes, it’s Henry! Henry is dirty from his trip into the woods. I wipe him off on my shorts.

""C’mon, Henry and Daisy. No more woods for us today.”

Mom calls me to come inside. It’s time for dinner. She won’t let me bring Henry inside the house, so I leave him on the deck.

""Where do you want to go tomorrow?” I ask Henry.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. We’ll just do it all again.”

Henry doesn’t answer. He’s the strong, silent type.

363,10,5,"First of all, no, we are not identical. Just because we sort of look alike doesn’t mean that we are identical twins.

Yes, Molly and I were born 12 minutes apart.

Yes, we have the same mom and dad.

Yes, we are both girls.

Yes, we both have blue eyes and curly brown hair.

Yes, we are both the same height.

That’s where it stops though. Everything else about us is totally different.

Molly loves reading. I’d rather rake leaves or clean windows than read a book.

Molly gets As on all of her tests. I’ve never even seen an A. Ever.

Molly loves shopping for clothes. I love shopping for sports equipment.

Molly’s name is easy to spell. My name, Kaitlyn, everyone spells wrong. 

See, we’re totally different. People always think we’re identical twins because at first they think we look the same. Once you look closely at us though, you could tell we’re fraternal twins. People don’t usually know the difference.

Fraternal twins are born one after another, just like identical twins. However, fraternal twins could be two boys, two girls, or even a boy and a girl. They also don’t look the same.

Like us.

Molly has a bigger nose. I have bigger lips. Molly also has a big freckle on her right cheek. I don’t.

Although we sometimes get annoyed when people get us confused, it does have its advantages. Like the time we pulled off the greatest twin switch in history. 

It all started at our new school. At the end of third grade, our dad got good news with his company. They moved him up to a vice-president or something. At first Mom was really happy, but then we found out we’d have to move because his new job was about five hours away.

Mom still pretended that she was excited. Molly and I knew better. She was just pretending because she knew Molly and I hated that we had to move. I was a little upset, but Molly was really mad. Molly said she wasn’t going, that she’d live in the basement of the school. Molly is known for being overly dramatic. 

About a year ago, Molly and I were out raking leaves when Molly poked her finger with a small branch. It was the tiniest cut in the world, but you would have thought she had her finger chopped off the way she was screaming. Dad came running out and carried her inside. Yes, she was actually carried inside. 

She got out of raking leaves for the next hour while she <i>rested</i> her finger. Mom wasn’t home at the time - she wouldn’t have fallen for Molly’s trickery. Dad still does though. He’s a sucker for her dramatics.    

Dad moved into an apartment a couple weeks later, until we could find a house. As a compromise, Mom stayed back with us so we could finish the last two months of the school year. The day that school finished, we moved, too.

It was a boring summer because we didn’t know anyone in Pegoria, our new town. About a week before we moved, Dad bought us a house. It was at the edge of this gigantic national forest, which meant that everywhere you looked all you saw were trees and mountains. We did have a cool lake in our backyard, but except for old Ms. Henderson, who lived by herself about a half mile away with her seven cats, there was no one else to play with anywhere near us. The population of the entire town was only 3,000 people! We were excited to start fourth grade so we could make some friends. 

We had never been in the same class before because our old school always wanted twins separated as much as possible. In Pegoria, that wasn’t an option. There was only one fourth grade class. 

We both had Mrs. Pritchett, a grey haired woman who looked like she had been teaching for fifty years. When Mrs. Pritchett introduced us, she mixed up our names.

Not exactly an unusual thing for us.

Normally, Molly jumps right in and corrects anyone who mixes us up. This time though, she didn’t.

I stared at Molly, expecting her to say something. When she finally did, it took me by complete surprise.

“Could you please both tell us a little something about yourself,” Mrs. Pritchett said. “Who would like to go first?”

Molly quickly raised her hand, and gave me a quick glance. I knew that look. A sly and mischievous smile coated in honey and syrup. A smile she’d used countless times to get her way. I knew it was trouble.

“Hi, my name is Kaitlyn,” Molly said. “I just moved here with my sister Molly. I love sports, helping out with chores around the house, and I have to admit, I don’t really like reading.”

The class snickered at the part about reading.

“Thank you, Kaitlyn,” Mrs. Pritchett said. “Alright, Molly. Tell us something about yourself.”

I looked up, realizing she was talking to me. I looked around. The entire class was looking at me. Molly just stood there, her hands clasped together, staring at me as well with her twisted smile.

I didn’t want to do it, but I didn’t really have a choice. I opened my mouth and said the words I would regret for years to come.

Yes, Molly and I were born 12 minutes apart.

Yes, we have the same mom and dad.

Yes, we are both girls.

Yes, we both have blue eyes and curly brown hair.

Yes, we are both the same height.

That’s where it stops though. Everything else about us is totally different.

Molly loves reading. I’d rather rake leaves or clean windows than read a book.

Molly gets As on all of her tests. I’ve never even seen an A. Ever.

Molly loves shopping for clothes. I love shopping for sports equipment.

Molly’s name is easy to spell. My name, Kaitlyn, everyone spells wrong. 

See, we’re totally different. People always think we’re identical twins because at first they think we look the same. Once you look closely at us though, you could tell we’re fraternal twins. People don’t usually know the difference.

Fraternal twins are born one after another, just like identical twins. However, fraternal twins could be two boys, two girls, or even a boy and a girl. They also don’t look the same.

Like us.

Molly has a bigger nose. I have bigger lips. Molly also has a big freckle on her right cheek. I don’t.

Although we sometimes get annoyed when people get us confused, it does have its advantages. Like the time we pulled off the greatest twin switch in history. 

It all started at our new school. At the end of third grade, our dad got good news with his company. They moved him up to a vice-president or something. At first Mom was really happy, but then we found out we’d have to move because his new job was about five hours away.

Mom still pretended that she was excited. Molly and I knew better. She was just pretending because she knew Molly and I hated that we had to move. I was a little upset, but Molly was really mad. Molly said she wasn’t going, that she’d live in the basement of the school. Molly is known for being overly dramatic. 

About a year ago, Molly and I were out raking leaves when Molly poked her finger with a small branch. It was the tiniest cut in the world, but you would have thought she had her finger chopped off the way she was screaming. Dad came running out and carried her inside. Yes, she was actually carried inside. 

She got out of raking leaves for the next hour while she <i>rested</i> her finger. Mom wasn’t home at the time - she wouldn’t have fallen for Molly’s trickery. Dad still does though. He’s a sucker for her dramatics.    

Dad moved into an apartment a couple weeks later, until we could find a house. As a compromise, Mom stayed back with us so we could finish the last two months of the school year. The day that school finished, we moved, too.

It was a boring summer because we didn’t know anyone in Pegoria, our new town. About a week before we moved, Dad bought us a house. It was at the edge of this gigantic national forest, which meant that everywhere you looked all you saw were trees and mountains. We did have a cool lake in our backyard, but except for old Ms. Henderson, who lived by herself about a half mile away with her seven cats, there was no one else to play with anywhere near us. The population of the entire town was only 3,000 people! We were excited to start fourth grade so we could make some friends. 

We had never been in the same class before because our old school always wanted twins separated as much as possible. In Pegoria, that wasn’t an option. There was only one fourth grade class.

364,10,4,"Mrs. Scudder is my third grade teacher.

I’ve been mostly lucky to stay off of her bad side. I’m not on her good side, because <i>no one</i> is on her good side, but at least I’m not on her bad side.

My name is Scott and I’m just a normal kid. 

I play soccer. I like to ride my bike. Both my sisters are annoying. 

My older sister, Amy, had Mrs. Scudder when she was in third grade. Amy said that she is fair because she’s mean to everyone. Equally.

I don’t believe that. When you’re on her bad side, you know it.

There’s this one girl, Mariah, who accidentally spilled paint on Mrs. Scudder’s desk back in October. 

It was a watery purple paint that my group was using for a project on the solar system. The paint was in one of those red plastic cups. Mariah was carrying it back from the sink when she tripped. 

The paint flew through the air and splattered all over Mrs. Scudder’s teacher stuff. All of her papers and whatever else teachers keep on their desks were covered in purple paint. 

The worst part was that Mrs. Scudder was sitting at her desk at the time. When she looked up she had purple paint all over her face.

If I didn’t know better, I would have laughed.

It was really funny.

It was also super scary. 

Mrs. Scudder's face turned bright red, her lip curled up like an angry momma bear, and I thought she was going to spit fire out of her eyeballs. 

Mariah looked too scared to even cry. 

***

Kids from Mr. Boone’s room down the hall told us later that they heard the yelling through their closed classroom door.

""It sounded like a monster,” Miles said.

""I thought someone was being attacked,” Katie said.

""I thought the world was ending,” Devin said. 

We all (except Mariah) laughed about it later, but not until recess. Not until we were sure Mrs. Scudder was far, far away. 

Mariah is definitely on her bad side.

Mrs. Scudder didn’t scream that loudly again until Derek joined our class.

It was a cold January day when he arrived. January 7 to be exact. 

We later knew it as the birth of Operation MSL.

Mrs. Scudder stood at the front of the classroom. She was behind Derek with her hands gripping his shoulders. She introduced us to Derek as ""our friend from the west coast.” Derek just moved here from California. 

He looked like he was from California. Like one of those surfer kids. 

Floppy blond hair.

Big freckles. 

A summer tan. In January.

I remember exactly what he was wearing. A blue bathing suit and a black tank top. Did I mention it was January? There was snow on the ground and this kid shows up in a bathing suit. 

I instantly liked him. So did all the other kids. 

I’m pretty sure Mrs. Scudder instantly hated him.

All the boys wanted to sit with him at lunch, but only eight kids are allowed at a table. I was one of them.

***



""Dude, what’s up with Mrs. Scudder?” Derek said. ""Does she ever smile?”

""No,” everyone answered at once.

We all laughed.

""No, seriously. Has she <i>ever</i> smiled?”

Heads shook no.

""Actually, there was one time,” I said. ""Mr. Caramel came on the announce-”

""Wait,” Derek interrupted. ""Some dude here is named Mr. Caramel?”

""Yeah. He’s the principal.”

Derek’s face broke into a huge toothy smile. ""The principal here is named after a candy?”

""Ha! I never thought of it like that,” I said.

""Is the librarian named Mrs. Gumballs?” Derek joked.

Everyone laughed again.

""So anyway,” I said, after I was done laughing. ""Mr. Caramel came on the announcements a few weeks ago in the morning. He said we were getting out of school early that day because we were getting a big snowstorm.”

""What do you mean, getting out early?” Derek asked.

""It means that we only have a half day of school,” I said.

""Whoa, that’s cool,” Derek said. ""That doesn’t happen in California.”

""Yeah, and that’s when Mrs. Scudder smiled.”

""She loves getting away from us,” Johnny said.

""Yeah,” Mason added. ""She was probably happy to go home so she could yell at her cat.”

""But that’s it,” Ricky said. ""She never smiled any other time.”

We all nodded in agreement.

Derek rubbed his hands together like a mad scientist.

""Well then, boys,” Derek said, looking at all of us with his giant grin. ""Operation Make-Scudder-Laugh is about to begin.”

We later renamed it Operation MSL so the girls wouldn’t know what we were doing, but they figured it out the next day anyway. 

Lindsay was the one who found out. She’s the smartest kid in class. Nothing gets by her. 

It turns out that it wasn’t a big deal though. The girls were just as excited to be a part of it as we were.

Derek was our official leader, but he let everyone be a part of the operation.

Plans were made. 

Secrets were exchanged.

Operation MSL had begun.

It was what made third grade the best and worst year of my life.

<b><i>Mt. Everest Base Camp (Nepal)</i></b>

 

The food isn’t horrible, but it definitely isn’t my mom’s cooking. I just finished my lunch, this mushy mixture of rice and lentils called Dal Bhat. It seems like this is on the menu every single day. Now I am sipping a mug of warm Nepali tea. Before arriving in Nepal, I never even liked tea. Here, everyone drinks tea. Even kids.

I may only be 12-years-old, but now I’m just as hooked on this delicious beverage as everyone else in Everest Base Camp. 

My dad and I arrived in base camp one month ago, in mid April. I’d been dreaming about this trip for the past five years. When I was seven-years-old, I saw a television show about a boy named Jordan Romero, who became the youngest person in the world to climb Mt. Everest at only 13.

I told my dad I wanted to do that. Not just to do it. To beat his record. 

Most dads would laugh, but my dad is not like most dads. An experienced mountaineer himself, he was a member of the Seven Summits Club. That means that he has climbed the highest peaks on all seven continents. He became a member a few years before I was born, when he climbed Everest for the first time. Since then, he’d climbed Everest two more times, both on the Chinese side and Nepal side of the mountain.

It was five years of dreaming and preparation, but here I was, right at the bottom of the tallest mountain on the entire planet. Technically, I was too young to even try climbing it. It was very dangerous - people died every year trying to make it to the top. Last year they ended the climbing season early when a block of ice the size of a mansion came roaring down the mountain. The avalanche killed 16 guides, mostly Sherpas, and out of respect almost everyone left the mountain days later. 

Since the climb was so dangerous, you were supposed to be 16-years-old, but Dad knew I was ready. I climbed more peaks than many of the adults trying to go up this year. Dad also worked for the U.S. government and had a lot of connections with the Napalese. Somehow he made it happen. 

Finishing the last drops of my tea, I left the mug with Tensing, who was the expedition cook. He was also the coolest Sherpa on the mountain.

“Tensing, have you seen my dad?” I asked.

“No, dude. No dad here.”

Tensing was a member of the Sherpa tribe, a tribe that lived in the Khumba valley surrounding Everest. Without the help of the Sherpa people, trips to the top of the world would be impossible. Sherpas were a major part of any expedition to Everest, helping with everything from cooking to climbing.

Tensing also liked to call me <i>dude</i> for some reason. I was from Maine, where no one said dude, but Tensing thought every American kid said dude. I think he watched too many old American TV shows.

“Dude, eat. Eat more food,” Tensing said in broken English, his big toothy smile making me grin. “I make big feast today.” 

“No thank you,” I said, rubbing my stomach. “I’m stuffed. I’m going over to see Pemba. Please tell my dad where I am if he comes by.”

“Okee dokee, dude. If hungry later. Come eat.”

“Thanks. See you in a bit.”

I pulled aside the big yellow flap that covered our mess hall tent, and immediately pulled down my sunglasses. Even though it was cold enough to need a coat and hat, the sun was bright, which made you want to take off your hat and coat. It didn’t really make sense, but at 17,598 feet above sea level, a lot of weather things were strange around here. Even at base camp, we were higher up than every mountain in North America except Mount McKinley in Alaska, which I climbed last year. I would have been the youngest to climb it, but Jordan Romero was one month younger than me when he reached its peak!

 Everest Base Camp was so high up that we had to spend 10 days hiking just to get used to the high altitude. If you tried to go up too high too fast you could get really sick.

I saw Pemba sitting down on a rock, a few tents away. Pemba was one of the climbing sherpas with our expedition. He was also really good at soccer. 

Everest Base Camp was really just a giant tent city that only existed during its short climbing season each spring. The rest of the year the weather was too unpredictable to attempt a climb. It was full of large expeditions like ours that had big tents to hang out in and even watch movies, and tiny one-person tents for people trying to climb the mountain by themselves.

Pemba had been teaching me a few soccer moves over the past few weeks, but the ground was so rocky here that it wasn’t easy. It was also hard to play soccer for too long because the high altitude made you get tired very quickly.

“Pemba, wanna play soccer?” I yelled.

I felt dizzy for a moment and almost fell down. It felt like the ground was shaking.

Pemba looked up at me and smiled, but then quickly turned his head away toward the sound.

I heard it, too. 

Everyone did. 

It sounded like a cross between a giant tree snapping in half and a bomb exploding.  

Almost instantly, the boom progressed into a low rumble, almost like that of an oncoming train.

I looked at Pemba. His eyes were wide with fear. 

“Avalanche!” he screamed. “Run!”

Now the source of the sound was clear. A massive cloud appeared from the top of the mountain next to Everest, and it was coming straight at me.

Even at base camp, we were higher up than every mountain in North America except Mount McKinley in Alaska, which I climbed last year. I would have been the youngest to climb it, but Jordan Romero was one month younger than me when he reached its peak!

 Everest Base Camp was so high up that we had to spend 10 days hiking just to get used to the high altitude. If you tried to go up too high too fast you could get really sick.

I saw Pemba sitting down on a rock, a few tents away. Pemba was one of the climbing sherpas with our expedition. He was also really good at soccer. 

Everest Base Camp was really just a giant tent city that only existed during its short climbing season each spring. The rest of the year the weather was too unpredictable to attempt a climb. It was full of large expeditions like ours that had big tents to hang out in and even watch movies, and tiny one-person tents for people trying to climb the mountain by themselves.

Pemba had been teaching me a few soccer moves over the past few weeks, but the ground was so rocky here that it wasn’t easy. It was also hard to play soccer for too long because the high altitude made you get tired very quickly.

“Pemba, wanna play soccer?” I yelled.

I felt dizzy for a moment and almost fell down. It felt like the ground was shaking.

Pemba looked up at me and smiled, but then quickly turned his head away toward the sound.

I heard it, too. 

Everyone did. 

It sounded like a cross between a giant tree snapping in half and a bomb exploding.  

Almost instantly, the boom progressed into a low rumble, almost like that of an oncoming train.

I looked at Pemba. His eyes were wide with fear. 

“Avalanche!” he screamed. “Run!”

Now the source of the sound was clear. A massive cloud appeared from the top of the mountain next to Everest, and it was coming straight at me.

The food isn’t horrible, but it definitely isn’t my mom’s cooking. I just finished my lunch, this mushy mixture of rice and lentils called Dal Bhat. It seems like this is on the menu every single day. Now I am sipping a mug of warm Nepali tea. Before arriving in Nepal, I never even liked tea. Here, everyone drinks tea. Even kids.

I may only be 12-years-old, but now I’m just as hooked on this delicious beverage as everyone else in Everest Base Camp. 

My dad and I arrived in base camp one month ago, in mid April. I’d been dreaming about this trip for the past five years. When I was seven-years-old, I saw a television show about a boy named Jordan Romero, who became the youngest person in the world to climb Mt. Everest at only 13.

I told my dad I wanted to do that. Not just to do it. To beat his record. 

Most dads would laugh, but my dad is not like most dads. An experienced mountaineer himself, he was a member of the Seven Summits Club. That means that he has climbed the highest peaks on all seven continents. He became a member a few years before I was born, when he climbed Everest for the first time. Since then, he’d climbed Everest two more times, both on the Chinese side and Nepal side of the mountain.

It was five years of dreaming and preparation, but here I was, right at the bottom of the tallest mountain on the entire planet. Technically, I was too young to even try climbing it. It was very dangerous - people died every year trying to make it to the top. Last year they ended the climbing season early when a block of ice the size of a mansion came roaring down the mountain. The avalanche killed 16 guides, mostly Sherpas, and out of respect almost everyone left the mountain days later. 

Since the climb was so dangerous, you were supposed to be 16-years-old, but Dad knew I was ready. I climbed more peaks than many of the adults trying to go up this year. Dad also worked for the U.S. government and had a lot of connections with the Napalese. Somehow he made it happen. 

Finishing the last drops of my tea, I left the mug with Tensing, who was the expedition cook. He was also the coolest Sherpa on the mountain.

“Tensing, have you seen my dad?” I asked.

“No, dude. No dad here.”

Tensing was a member of the Sherpa tribe, a tribe that lived in the Khumba valley surrounding Everest. Without the help of the Sherpa people, trips to the top of the world would be impossible. Sherpas were a major part of any expedition to Everest, helping with everything from cooking to climbing.

Tensing also liked to call me <i>dude</i> for some reason. I was from Maine, where no one said dude, but Tensing thought every American kid said dude. I think he watched too many old American TV shows.

“Dude, eat. Eat more food,” Tensing said in broken English, his big toothy smile making me grin. “I make big feast today.” 

“No thank you,” I said, rubbing my stomach. “I’m stuffed. I’m going over to see Pemba. Please tell my dad where I am if he comes by.”

“Okee dokee, dude. If hungry later. Come eat.”

“Thanks. See you in a bit.”

I pulled aside the big yellow flap that covered our mess hall tent, and immediately pulled down my sunglasses. Even though it was cold enough to need a coat and hat, the sun was bright, which made you want to take off your hat and coat.

Since then, he’d climbed Everest two more times, both on the Chinese side and Nepal side of the mountain.

It was five years of dreaming and preparation, but here I was, right at the bottom of the tallest mountain on the entire planet. Technically, I was too young to even try climbing it. It was very dangerous - people died every year trying to make it to the top. Last year they ended the climbing season early when a block of ice the size of a mansion came roaring down the mountain. The avalanche killed 16 guides, mostly Sherpas, and out of respect almost everyone left the mountain days later. 

Since the climb was so dangerous, you were supposed to be 16-years-old, but Dad knew I was ready. I climbed more peaks than many of the adults trying to go up this year. Dad also worked for the U.S. government and had a lot of connections with the Napalese. Somehow he made it happen. 

Finishing the last drops of my tea, I left the mug with Tensing, who was the expedition cook. He was also the coolest Sherpa on the mountain.

“Tensing, have you seen my dad?” I asked.

“No, dude. No dad here.”

Tensing was a member of the Sherpa tribe, a tribe that lived in the Khumba valley surrounding Everest. Without the help of the Sherpa people, trips to the top of the world would be impossible. Sherpas were a major part of any expedition to Everest, helping with everything from cooking to climbing.

Tensing also liked to call me <i>dude</i> for some reason. I was from Maine, where no one said dude, but Tensing thought every American kid said dude. I think he watched too many old American TV shows.

“Dude, eat. Eat more food,” Tensing said in broken English, his big toothy smile making me grin. “I make big feast today.” 

“No thank you,” I said, rubbing my stomach. “I’m stuffed. I’m going over to see Pemba. Please tell my dad where I am if he comes by.”

“Okee dokee, dude. If hungry later. Come eat.”

“Thanks. See you in a bit.”

I pulled aside the big yellow flap that covered our mess hall tent, and immediately pulled down my sunglasses. Even though it was cold enough to need a coat and hat, the sun was bright, which made you want to take off your hat and coat. It didn’t really make sense, but at 17,598 feet above sea level, a lot of weather things were strange around here. Even at base camp, we were higher up than every mountain in North America except Mount McKinley in Alaska, which I climbed last year. I would have been the youngest to climb it, but Jordan Romero was one month younger than me when he reached its peak!

 Everest Base Camp was so high up that we had to spend 10 days hiking just to get used to the high altitude. If you tried to go up too high too fast you could get really sick.

I saw Pemba sitting down on a rock, a few tents away. Pemba was one of the climbing sherpas with our expedition. He was also really good at soccer. 

Everest Base Camp was really just a giant tent city that only existed during its short climbing season each spring. The rest of the year the weather was too unpredictable to attempt a climb. It was full of large expeditions like ours that had big tents to hang out in and even watch movies, and tiny one-person tents for people trying to climb the mountain by themselves.

Pemba had been teaching me a few soccer moves over the past few weeks, but the ground was so rocky here that it wasn’t easy. It was also hard to play soccer for too long because the high altitude made you get tired very quickly.

“Pemba, wanna play soccer?” I yelled.

I felt dizzy for a moment and almost fell down. It felt like the ground was shaking.

Pemba looked up at me and smiled, but then quickly turned his head away toward the sound.

I heard it, too. 

Everyone did. 

It sounded like a cross between a giant tree snapping in half and a bomb exploding.  

Almost instantly, the boom progressed into a low rumble, almost like that of an oncoming train.

I looked at Pemba. His eyes were wide with fear. 

“Avalanche!” he screamed. “Run!”

Now the source of the sound was clear. A massive cloud appeared from the top of the mountain next to Everest, and it was coming straight at me.

Hi. My name is Molly. 

I am just a normal kid, like every other kid. But today is not a normal day.

Today I start Grade 2. You might be thinking, why am I so excited to start school? Well, the thing is, Grade 2 is going to be different.

This year I get to be in Mrs. Jenkin’s class. Mrs. Jenkin’s classroom is special because it has a class pet named Snoopy.

He is a guinea pig. He is black and white, and has long hair that covers his eyes. I know this because in Grade 1 I used to walk by Mrs. Jenkin’s classroom just to see Snoopy. 

I was so jealous of the Grade 2 students that got to feed and take care of Snoopy. Mrs. Jenkin’s even let the students take Snoopy home!

I love animals, but my mom and dad will not let me have a pet. I beg and beg, but they still say no. They say a pet is a lot of work, and I am too young to have that kind of responsibility.

But little did they know, I have a plan.

 

<b>Chapter 2</b>

“Molly, you are going to be late for school,” Mom yells from the kitchen.

I am almost ready, but I can’t find my favorite shoes. The sparkly silver sneakers with bright pink laces.

I bend down and look under the bed. There they are! I slip one foot inside, and then the other.

“Molly, the bus is going to be here any minute!”

Mom is getting upset now. I better hurry. The problem is that I just learned how to tie my shoes over the summer.

I take both laces in my hands and think carefully.

“Over, under, pull it tight,” I think in my head. “Make a bow and pull it through to do it right.” 

Got it!

I do the same with the other shoe, and run downstairs.

Jack is sitting at the kitchen table. He is my little brother. He’s not big enough to go to real school yet. He goes to preschool a few days a week. Mom says it will get him ready for big kid school.

“Molly, hurry up and eat some breakfast,” Mom says.

I sit next to my brother, and look down at my plate. Waffles! My favourite.

“Thanks, Mom,” I say.

Mom gives me a smile as she wipes my brother’s face with a napkin.

I eat my breakfast quickly, and run to the door.

Mom is already there with my backpack in her hand. “Have a great first day of Grade 2. I can’t wait to hear all about it.”

She helps me put on my backpack and gives me a kiss on the head.

“Bye!” I yell as I walk down the driveway.

Just as I reach the end the bus comes around the corner. Perfect timing. The bus stops at the end of our driveway. I turn around and give another wave to Mom. I step up the stairs of the bus.

“This is going to be a great year,” I think in my head.

<b>Chapter 3</b>

I find a seat near the front of the class. My friend Amy sits down at the desk next to mine.

I haven’t seen Amy all summer because she went away to soccer camp.

“Hi Molly,” she says.

“Hi Amy, how was camp?” I ask.

 “It was fun. I played soccer every day and got to stay with a different family. They had a pool and everything!” she says.

“That sounds fun,” I say. I try to keep my eyes on Amy as she talks more about camp, but I can’t help but notice Snoopy’s cage.

It is on a small table beside the window near the reading corner.

I wonder to myself who will get to take Snoopy home first? It just has to be me! The sooner I take Snoopy home, the sooner Mom and Dad will see how responsible I am and let me have my very own pet.

“Molly, are you listening?” Amy asks, sounding frustrated.

“Oh sorry,” I say. “Hey do you know if Snoopy is in his cage?” 

Amy just rolls her eyes at me.

Just then Mrs. Jenkins starts to speak in front of the class. “Good morning class, and welcome to Grade 2.”

369,5,4,"Lucy and Alex had all kinds of books: 
storybooks, science books, some just for cooks.
Some smelled like dust, and others were new, 
and some had hard covers, but only a few.

Some books had pictures and some were without,
but neither one knew what these were about.
Because Lucy and Alex, back when they were small,
just played with their books, but read not at all.

They used all their books in all kinds of ways.
As sketchpads, as door-stops, and even a maze.
They piled them up and climbed way up high,
for a better view, when they wanted to spy. 
And sometimes, when monsters and ghosts would come near,
they built a strong fort, so they’d sleep without fear.

One day, their mother came into their room. 
She glanced all around and she started to fume.
She said, ""Look at these books all over the floor!” 
""You climb them and use them as stops for the door!”
""You use them for warding off monsters in bed,
but oh, how I wish you would <i>read</i> them instead!”

But Lucy and Alex said impatiently,
""We need them for crossing this moat! Don’t you see?” 
""The carpet is water, this book is a rock,
and only from one to the next can we walk.”

Their mother just sighed and nodded her head,
then spoke to them softly, and here’s what she said:
""The reading fairy will think it’s too bad.
When children don’t read, she gets very sad.”

Lucy and Alex then stopped suddenly,
and asked who this reading fairy might be.
""The reading fairy,” their mother began,
looks after the books in all of the lands.”

""She’s read every story, and knows them by heart, 
the first word, the last word, and each little part.” 
""She treasures her books, and loves nothing more, 
than sharing her gifts with the kids she adores.” 

""But when children don’t read, and their books are for play, 
then she becomes sad and starts fading away.”
That night, in their dreams, the fairy came down,
and whisked them away in her silvery gown. 

She showed them the places where readers can go, 
and magical spells that only <i>they</i> know.
They visited castles with dragons and moats…
They searched for lost treasure with pirates on boats...

They visited space and sat on the moon....
They visited jungles with bears and baboons…
They visited sweet shops with cakes and ice creams…
And places that only existed in dreams…

The fairy explained that these worlds live in books. 
They’re inside the covers, if only you look.
And when they awoke in their beds the next day, 
they wished to go back to those worlds right away. 

So Lucy and Alex did just as she said. 
They ran to their books and they read, and they read.
When their mother woke up, to her shock and delight, 
she saw in their room an unusual sight.

Lucy and Alex were reading away, 
not throwing, not climbing - at least for today.
And the reading fairy was glad in her heart, 
and thought to herself, ""Well, it’s good a start.”

370,10,2,"My name is Holly. It is a hot summer day. My family is going to the beach.

When we get to the beach we eat lunch. I eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. My little brother, James, eats gross baby food. My mom and dad eat gross adult food. I eat my sandwich fast because I want to go play.

When I am done eating I take out my shovels and buckets. I have three shovels and two buckets. My red bucket is for making towers. My blue bucket is round. My shovels are all different sizes.

It is time to build the sandcastle. The first thing I have to do is make a big pile of sand. At first it is easy to dig. The sand is not heavy. I dig deeper. The sand is getting heavier. Now it is not so easy to dig.

My pile of sand is huge now. It is taller than James. Now it is time to start carving my sandcastle.

I push on the pile of sand with both hands to make it stronger. Then I fill my red bucket with sand, and dump it upside down on the pile. This is how I make the towers. When I slowly take off the bucket, there is a tower. I make three more towers.

I use my smallest shovel to make windows in the towers. I use my medium shovel to make doors in the towers. I use my biggest shovel to make the towers stronger.

Now it is time to dig a moat. A moat is a hole all the way around the castle that you fill with water. At first it is easy to dig. The sand is not heavy. I dig deeper. The sand is getting heavier. Now it is not so easy to dig.

I use all the extra sand I dig up to make a wall around the castle. It is time to fill the moat with water. I walk down to the ocean, and fill my blue bucket with water. James tries to follow me and my dad picks him up.

The bucket is too heavy to carry so I dump some water out. It is hard to walk, but I make it back to the sandcastle. I dump the water in the moat. It barely fills any of the moat. This is going to take a lot of trips to the ocean.

I go back and forth many times. Finally, the water is starting to fill the moat. After many more trips, the moat is finally full! I am so tired that I lay down in the sand and close my eyes.

I hear my mom yelling, but it is too late. The sandcastle is destroyed. It was destroyed by a monster. A monster named James. A two-year-old sandcastle monster.

The towers are ruined. The wall is ruined. The moat is ruined.

I am so mad. I am ready to cry. Then James comes over, gives me a big hug, and says “sorry”.

I cannot be mad at James. I hug him back and tell him it is okay. I still love him, even if he <i>is</i> a sandcastle monster.

371,5,2,"There once was a place,
in a far away land.
A wonderful space,
where nothing was bland.

The trees were all tall,
and the leaves were all green.
The lakes were so deep,
and everything was clean.

This place was called Arno,
as you’ll soon come to know.

Away from Arno,
was a boy named Jon.
He dreamed of Arno,
each night as he yawned.

As he would drift,
deep deep into sleep,
he’d picture the trip
to lakes so deep.

He longed for Arno,
a place you’ll soon come to know.

Each day Jon would wake,
as the sun shined in beams.
He would draw and create,
pictures of his dreams.

He drew all the lakes,
all the forest and hills.
The rabbits, the snakes,
and the porcupine’s quills.

He longed for Arno,
a place we promise, you’ll soon come to know.

Jon always went to school,
and sat in his class.
He would follow each rule,
and each test he would pass.

The teacher had them write,
stories in their book.
Jon’s mind would take flight,
with each turn his tale took. 

He wrote of Arno,
a place we still promise, you’ll soon come to know.

That day as Jon walked,
all the way home.
He found himself shocked,
at the sight of a gnome!

A wee person so small,
that Jon could barely see.
A gnome that was not tall,
but sang as loud as three!

The gnome was from Arno,
a place you’ll soon come to know.

""Who are you?”
asked Jon, quite shocked.
""I am Rilo, it’s true!”
The gnome danced as he talked.

""Where do you come from?”
asked Jon, still afraid.
""An island known only to some,”
Rilo said as he played. 

The island of Arno,
a place you’ll very soon come to know.

""Where is Arno found?”
asked Jon, still unsure.
""The end of the long way around,”
Rilo yelled from the floor.

""That’s not a way to a place,”
said Jon quite annoyed.
A smile appeared on Rilo’s face,
as with Jon the gnome toyed.

""Follow me to Arno… 
a place you are now about to know”.

""We’ll be back in a flash,”
said Rilo the wee gnome.
""Unless we should crash,
I’ll bring you back home”.

""Crash what?” asked Jon,
as he chased to catch up.
Rilo skipped along,
singing back, ""The flying teacup.”

""The flying teacup will take us to Arno,
a place you’ll soon come to know.”

Jon ran home very fast.
Would his parents say yes?
A great trip at last,
to the place he’d soon like best.

They opened the door,
and both said ""Hello”.
Down went Jon’s mother,
fainting at first sight of Rilo.

""Wake up- we are going to Arno,
a place we’ll all soon get to know”.

They all climbed aboard
the bright colored cup.
Away they soared,
Rilo, Jon, and his parents and pup.

""This cup has magic powers,”
Rilo said as they started to spin.
Jon’s eyes fell on flowers,
lakes, and Rilo’s sly grin.

""We’ve arrived in Arno, 
the secret to which you’ll soon know!”

Wide-eyed and amazed,
Jon looked every which way.
""It’s not possible,” quite dazed,
he heard his parents say!

""Anything can be true,”
said Rilo quite proud.
""Beauty comes from the things that you do,”
he smiled, calling aloud.

""We’ve arrived in Arno, 
the secret to which, we promise you’ll soon know!”

""What do you mean,
by the things that you do?”
With the beauty he’d seen,
how were these words true?

""You’ll soon wake up!
This is all just a dream.
The tea cup, and Arno,
are not quite what they seem.

You’re about to learn the secret of Arno,
a secret that I hope you’ll forever know”.

The gnome waved a hand,
and came very close.
The grass turned to sand.
Jon thought he’d seen a ghost.

""Arno is the earth,
the spirit of all things.
We must not hurt,
the nature from which life springs!

You’re learning the secret of Arno,
a secret that I hope you’ll forever know!

So when you wake up,
remember my words.
Remember the beauty, the tea cup,
the animals in herds.

371,5,2,"There once was a place,
in a far away land.
A wonderful space,
where nothing was bland.

The trees were all tall,
and the leaves were all green.
The lakes were so deep,
and everything was clean.

This place was called Arno,
as you’ll soon come to know.

Away from Arno,
was a boy named Jon.
He dreamed of Arno,
each night as he yawned.

As he would drift,
deep deep into sleep,
he’d picture the trip
to lakes so deep.

He longed for Arno,
a place you’ll soon come to know.

Each day Jon would wake,
as the sun shined in beams.
He would draw and create,
pictures of his dreams.

He drew all the lakes,
all the forest and hills.
The rabbits, the snakes,
and the porcupine’s quills.

He longed for Arno,
a place we promise, you’ll soon come to know.

Jon always went to school,
and sat in his class.
He would follow each rule,
and each test he would pass.

The teacher had them write,
stories in their book.
Jon’s mind would take flight,
with each turn his tale took. 

He wrote of Arno,
a place we still promise, you’ll soon come to know.

That day as Jon walked,
all the way home.
He found himself shocked,
at the sight of a gnome!

A wee person so small,
that Jon could barely see.
A gnome that was not tall,
but sang as loud as three!

The gnome was from Arno,
a place you’ll soon come to know.

""Who are you?”
asked Jon, quite shocked.
""I am Rilo, it’s true!”
The gnome danced as he talked.

""Where do you come from?”
asked Jon, still afraid.
""An island known only to some,”
Rilo said as he played. 

The island of Arno,
a place you’ll very soon come to know.

""Where is Arno found?”
asked Jon, still unsure.
""The end of the long way around,”
Rilo yelled from the floor.

""That’s not a way to a place,”
said Jon quite annoyed.
A smile appeared on Rilo’s face,
as with Jon the gnome toyed.

""Follow me to Arno… 
a place you are now about to know”.

""We’ll be back in a flash,”
said Rilo the wee gnome.
""Unless we should crash,
I’ll bring you back home”.

""Crash what?” asked Jon,
as he chased to catch up.
Rilo skipped along,
singing back, ""The flying teacup.”

""The flying teacup will take us to Arno,
a place you’ll soon come to know.”

Jon ran home very fast.
Would his parents say yes?
A great trip at last,
to the place he’d soon like best.

They opened the door,
and both said ""Hello”.
Down went Jon’s mother,
fainting at first sight of Rilo.

""Wake up- we are going to Arno,
a place we’ll all soon get to know”.

They all climbed aboard
the bright colored cup.
Away they soared,
Rilo, Jon, and his parents and pup.

""This cup has magic powers,”
Rilo said as they started to spin.
Jon’s eyes fell on flowers,
lakes, and Rilo’s sly grin.

""We’ve arrived in Arno, 
the secret to which you’ll soon know!”

Wide-eyed and amazed,
Jon looked every which way.
""It’s not possible,” quite dazed,
he heard his parents say!

""Anything can be true,”
said Rilo quite proud.
""Beauty comes from the things that you do,”
he smiled, calling aloud.

""We’ve arrived in Arno, 
the secret to which, we promise you’ll soon know!”

""What do you mean,
by the things that you do?”
With the beauty he’d seen,
how were these words true?

""You’ll soon wake up!
This is all just a dream.
The tea cup, and Arno,
are not quite what they seem.

You’re about to learn the secret of Arno,
a secret that I hope you’ll forever know”.

The gnome waved a hand,
and came very close.
The grass turned to sand.
Jon thought he’d seen a ghost.

""Arno is the earth,
the spirit of all things.
We must not hurt,
the nature from which life springs!

You’re learning the secret of Arno,
a secret that I hope you’ll forever know!

So when you wake up,
remember my words.

372,10,3,"There once was a man with little old feet,
Who came every day to the park down the street.

He sat on the bench with his small bag of seed,
And all of the little birds there he would feed.

Before very long, a great many came,
And when each arrived, he called them by name.

The birds greeted him, as each came along,
And each sang to him, their own little song.

The sparrows sang higher, the ravens sang low,
And the starlings all chirped as they swooped to and fro.

The robins all sang their sweet melody,
And the chickadees sang, ""chick-a-dee-dee-dee-dee.”

The old pigeons cooed with a sad kind of note,
And the mourning dove sang with a frog in her throat.

The geese honked away, in Canadian style,
And the little ducks quacked as they marched single file.  

The thrushes were merry, the cardinals proud,
And everyone thought that the seagulls were loud!

While they sang their tunes, the man waved his hand,
Conducting them like his own little band.

They ate from his palm and chirped their great thanks,
Then flew to their flock to rejoin the ranks.

They swooped and they soared in lovely formations,
On wings that had flown them to many far nations.

Watching them play on the wind like a kite,
My little mind raced with joy and delight.

They seemed so at ease and, though it’s absurd,
I thought to myself, ""...wish I was a bird.”

The days became cool and the trees became bare, 
And one day that man in the park wasn’t there.

I ran to his bench and looked all around,
But the little old man was not to be found.

I went to my to mother with tearful lament,
And asked if she knew where the little man went.

She held my small hand and smiled a sad smile,
And said, ""it was nice that he stayed for a while.”

""But like his dear friends - the blue jay and bittern, 
He went with the birds and flew south for the winter.”

That cake was the most beautiful thing he had ever laid his eyes on. His mouth was watering just looking at it. He knew this was the cake to get for Roger. On the way home, Wally was tempted many times to eat Roger the Rooster’s cake. But he didn’t. He knew it was a gift for his friend.

Later that day, the party began.

When Wally showed up with the cake to the party, everyone stared at it with big smiles. Wally left the cake in the kitchen where Roger would not see it. Wally was the only one who knew where the cake was.

As the party started and games were played, Wally became very hungry. His hunger made him think of how good the cake had looked in the bakery. Wally left the games and snuck into the kitchen.

The cake sat there looking simply amazing. Suddenly, he could not stop himself any more! Wally dove face first into the cake.

Before he knew it, the cake was gone, and icing was all over his face. As he turned around, there was Roger the Rooster with tears rolling down his eyes. Wally knew he had made Roger very sad. Roger left the kitchen, went to his room, and locked the door.

Wally felt bad. He knew he had to find something to make this up to Roger. He went to Paddy the Panda’s Pastry Shop to find an even better cake.  He spent all the money he had on a cake that was 10 times as big as the first! 

It had sparklers all around the bottom, fireworks poking out the top, gummy bears stuck to every inch, chocolate icing on the outside, ice cream on the inside, AND a message written in gumballs that said “Happy Birthday Roger!”.

Wally carefully ran back to the party with the cake and put it on the table. He got the others to light it and then knocked on Roger’s door. Roger opened his door and saw the best cake he had ever seen in his life! It was taller than the fridge! It was wider than the couch! Wally and their friends sang “Happy Birthday” to Roger and it put a big smile back on his face.

Wally told Roger that he was sorry for eating the first cake. They hugged.

377,11,5,"Neil stepped into the central hub of the spaceship. It didn’t look the way that he had imagined it from all the movies and his comics. He had expected it to be filled with thousands of tiny flashing lights, and shining multicolored buttons. He had thought there would be levers and switches and computer screens showing complicated radar readings. But there was none of that. 

Instead the hub was very small, and very dark. The walls were all curved and the ceiling was low. It made him feel like he was inside a bird’s egg. Strangest of all, there were no windows in this room. How was he supposed to see out, let alone steer the ship? 

He took another step into the room, though it was difficult to see. His footsteps were muffled by thick carpeting that covered every inch of the floor, walls, and ceiling. In fact, as he moved he made no sound at all. Now that Neil noticed it, the room was so silent that it was almost like sound was being sucked out of it completely. That thought sent a cold shiver up the back of his neck.

His eyes finally adjusted enough to the dark to notice a chair stationed in front of him. He walked around to the front and sat down. A strange tingling sensation ran up his legs and down his arms. He blinked, and for the split second his eyes were closed he saw something– a flash of light! He closed his eyes again. 

He was looking out from the front end of the ship. He could see the infinite expanse of blackness and stars beyond. But he wasn’t looking out a window of the ship at this view. He <i>was</i> the ship. 

As that surreal realization settled into place, a small voice chimed inside his head.

Then he turned on the stove and took out a big pan. Grayson poured the mix into the pan in little circles. Soon it started to cook. 

He flipped the pancakes once. Success! Perfection!

Then his sister Jane came over. Jane started telling Grayson all about her Super Strawberry lip gloss. She waved it in front of his face and put it under his nose to sniff. But Grayson didn’t want his first ever banana pancakes to burn, so he told Jane to go away. 

“Fine!” Jane huffed, stomping away. “I’m going to have a tea party and <i>you’re</i> not invited!” She went to her room and closed the door.

Grayson checked his pancakes, but they still weren't ready yet. Suddenly his brother Ethan flew into the kitchen, attacking Grayson with a pillow. Grayson grabbed the pillow and threw it across the room. Ethan ran after it and came back laughing. 

“What are you doing?” he asked.

Grayson saw that his pancakes were finally done. “Banana pancakes,” he said. He switched off the stove and looked Ethan dead in the eye. “And you’re not having any.” Then Grayson turned back around and slid the pancakes onto a plate. 

“We’ll see about that…” Ethan mumbled. 

Grayson put the plate of pancakes down on the table. Then he walked across the room to the fridge and grabbed the maple syrup. Then he opened the drawer and pulled out a knife and fork. But when he got back to his plate, both Ethan and the plate of pancakes were gone!

Grayson looked around, but they were nowhere to be found. Just when Grayson was about to explode with anger, he heard a small laugh. <i>They must be nearby.</i>

He checked under the table, behind the couch, and even in the shower! Then he realised there was one place he had never checked. <i>The big cabinet under the sink.</i>

Grayson ran over to the cabinet. But before he got a chance to pull open the doors, Ethan burst out of it, giggling madly. Without looking back, Ethan wrenched open the front door and ran outside.

Grayson picked the empty plate up off the floor. There wasn’t even a crumb left.

390,10,5,"Inga was new on the street and Alexa was her new friend. The two were walking to the supermarket on an errand for Alexa’s mum with a crisp ten dollar bill. Alexa was smacking a large piece of gum as they went. Inga was telling Alexa about the house she used to live in. But then Alexa suddenly grabbed her arm and pulled her down behind a garbage can. 

“Hey, what are you–” Inga began. But Alexa held a finger over her mouth to tell her to be quiet. Then she carefully poked her head around the side.

She whispered back to Inga over her shoulder. “Come look,” she said. 

Inga crawled forward and peered out over Alexa’s head. She didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. Inga liked her new street. The houses were small and the sidewalks were cracked, but almost every single garden was exploding with flowers. Many of them had odd little stone statues of lions, or babies, or eagles too. From here Inga could see the tallest tree on the block, and the spot where Alexa had said that she broke her leg once. But all of that seemed normal.

“What are you talking about?” she whispered. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”

Alexa rolled her eyes. She jutted her finger out slightly, careful not to let it extend beyond the garbage can. Her eyes were wide and she seemed to be trying to point at something with her eyebrows. “Right. There. Her!” she mumbled through clenched teeth.

Inga looked out again where Alexa had pointed. She saw a woman about her mom’s age walking down her driveway to the sidewalk. She wore broken plastic sandals and red capris that seemed to just barely stretch across her sizeable backside. 

“Who’s that?” Inga whispered, crawling back to safety behind the garbage can.

“That’s Ms. Vesser,” Alexa replied, looking excited. “And in the entire twelve long years of my life, I’ve never EVER seen her leave her house. We’ve gotta follow her.”

406,4,5,"Ayanna swam farther and farther out into the dark, deep lake. At this time of night, the water was pitch black and very still. It looked like the sky’s very own hand-mirror, reflecting the sparkling stars above. 

The day had been hot and the water was still warm. In fact, it was almost the exact temperature of Ayanna’s own skin. She felt almost like her body was floating through nothingness. A single loon called out from the surrounding trees. The sound echoed across the water.

Ayanna glided closer to the lake’s center. She thought about how terrible the day had been. She thought about how glad she was to be away from it all now, to be alone. She listened to the gentle sound of droplets falling from her fingertips back into the smooth water. 

Then she saw something bright bobbing towards her. She swam toward it and stopped, treading water. It was so bright that she had to squint to see its shape. It was a huge diamond! Looking around she suddenly noticed several others floating nearby. They were so beautiful, shimmering and winking in the blackness. They almost looked like stars fallen to Earth, Ayanna thought.

It was that very thought that made her look up. And what she saw there took her breath away. High above her she saw, not the sky, but the shore she had just left. She saw the tops of pointed green trees and the rocky bank of the lake. She saw the shining surface of the lake itself! She saw it all as though from high above. But how could that possibly be?

The little light that reached this place was green and muted. This was a lifeless land. Nothing dwelt here. Nothing but pebbles, vast space, and darkness. Guartha moved quickly through it towards the tall canyon wall. 

Its smooth slate face rose up for miles above him, beyond sight. Right down the middle was a narrow, craggy opening. All looked pitch black within it. But Guartha knew where it led. Barely wide enough for his slender form, he squeezed through it. He swam for a long time through the darkness. He took care not to scrape against the rough rock sides. Finally he came to the opening on the other end. His eyes were greeted by the familiar sight: a riot of color and motion.

Her flip flops made a rhythmic <i>sik-thock-shhh</i> as she walked. This part of the beach was completely empty, now that she looked around– which was unusual since it was normally a favorite spot for canoodling couples. She brushed her hands together to rid them of sand. Some of it fell to her feet but the rest remained undisturbed. She stopped and wiped her hands more vigorously against her shorts. But looking down her hands were still covered in tiny beige granules. She picked at them but they wouldn’t budge. She noticed vaguely that her heart had begun galloping faster. She dug into one palm with her nail, determined now to pry the sand free from her skin– and it finally came loose. 

But as it fell something else happened too. A small sinkhole opened up where the grain of sand had just been. Now more sand was cascading through it, and more and more, widening the sinkhole until the center of her hand was nothing but a gaping emptiness with sand flowing through it like some insane hourglass. Then her fingers began to crumble and float away on the air. Pri tried to run, and even made it a few hopeful steps before she collapsed. 

Ten minutes later the sun was just a smoldering sliver on the horizon and the beach was empty once more. A pair of flip flops and an old beach bag sat on the sand in the growing darkness. The corner of a beach towel fluttered gently on the breeze.

Dokkaebi appear in many forms, but are usually said to look impressive or scary– often arriving in a flash of large blue flames. These spirits are powerful and mischievous. They are as likely to play a trick on a passing human as they are to help them. Dokkaebi are formed when a spirit possesses an abandoned household item, or an object stained with human blood. They are known to sometimes carry magical items like an invisibility cloak or a club that can summon objects. 
	According to legends, dokkaebi are fantastic wrestlers, and are tough to defeat if they decide to challenge you. Some tales say their only weakness is their right side. Others say they only have one leg, and that can be their downfall. 
	But one story tells of an old man who tricked a dokkaebi into making him rich. He told the spirit that money was his greatest fear. The dokkaebi, seeking to frighten the man, threw bags and bags of money at him. Thinking he had won, the dokkaebi left, and the old man was richer than he ever could have dreamed!

The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.

But there <i>was</i> life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow.

Their irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it, doubled upon it, outdistanced it. The wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of speech and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman.

It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.

We remained mute, not stirring, and not knowing what surprise awaited us, whether agreeable or disagreeable. A sliding noise was heard: one would have said that panels were working at the sides of the Nautilus.

Suddenly light broke at each side of the saloon, through two oblong openings. The liquid mass appeared vividly lit up by the electric gleam. Two crystal plates separated us from the sea. At first I trembled at the thought that this frail partition might break, but strong bands of copper bound them, giving an almost infinite power of resistance.

The sea was distinctly visible for a mile all round the Nautilus. What a spectacle! What pen can describe it? Who could paint the effects of the light through those transparent sheets of water, and the softness of the successive gradations from the lower to the superior strata of the ocean?

After the first day we said little to one another, and lay in our places in the boat and stared at the horizon, or watched, with eyes that grew larger and more haggard every day, the misery and weakness gaining upon our companions. The sun became pitiless. The water ended on the fourth day, and we were already thinking strange things and saying them with our eyes; but it was, I think, the sixth before Helmar gave voice to the thing we had all been thinking. I remember our voices were dry and thin, so that we bent towards one another and spared our words. I stood out against it with all my might, was rather for scuttling the boat and perishing together among the sharks that followed us; but when Helmar said that if his proposal was accepted we should have drink, the sailor came round to him.

Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown <i>him</i> far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily.

The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying down through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a fluttering newspaper in her hand.

Aldred's snow statue made quite a sensation at the Grange. Miss Drummond thought so highly of it that she had it photographed, and invited many of her friends from Chetbourne to come and see it. It was such a daring and original project for a girl of only fifteen to have carried out entirely alone that she felt it reflected credit on the school to possess so clever a pupil. Aldred was praised to her heart's content, and received so much attention from teachers and visitors that she could certainly consider herself, for the time being, the most important person at Birkwood.

Instead, most testing surrounded the teachings of Confucius (a philosopher of great importance to Chinese culture). Critics claim that the exams fostered conformity, rather than creativity. Supporters say they promoted strong cultural unity and the virtue of education. Either way, the exams were incredibly rigorous.

Testing took place over the course of three days. During these three days, examinees wrote the test in small cells. They also ate all their meals and slept in those cells. They were not allowed to communicate with their peers. Because pressure to pass was so high, some participants resorted to cheating. Some tried to bribe the examiners. Others wrote out cheat sheets on their underwear!

The Chinese abolished imperial exams in 1905. However, the idea of standardized exams is still popular today.

628,3,7,"The Olmecs were an ancient people that thrived between 1500 BCE and 400 BCE. They lived in the tropical region of modern-day Mexico. The Olmec people had a very rich society and culture: They had widespread systems of trade; They farmed maize, beans, and squash; They built basic aqueducts and pyramids; They were master sculptors; They had a complex religion with many rituals and gods. Their culture had a huge influence on later societies. And influence was all that was left– because the Olmecs disappeared.
	Around 400 BCE, the major Olmec cities were abandoned, and no one knows why. Many scholars agree that the environment was likely a major cause. Some believe that Olmec farming techniques left too much silt in their rivers. Others think that changes in climate or tectonic shifting affected their crops. Some experts say that an erupting volcano was the culprit! For now, the end of this great society remains a mystery.

“Now my dears,” said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, “you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor. Now run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out.”

It soared upward with a swift rush, till it reached its topmost note, where it persisted, palpitant and tense, and then slowly died away. It might have been a lost soul wailing, had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness. The front man turned his head until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind. And then, across the narrow oblong box, each nodded to the other.

A second cry arose, piercing the silence with needle-like shrillness. Both men located the sound. It was to the rear, somewhere in the snow expanse they had just traversed. A third and answering cry arose, also to the rear and to the left of the second cry.

As they slid along, noiseless as shadows, in the moonlight, they came upon a run-way. Both noses went down to the footprints in the snow. These footprints were very fresh. One Eye ran ahead cautiously, his mate at his heels. The broad pads of their feet were spread wide and in contact with the snow were like velvet. One Eye caught sight of a dim movement of white in the midst of the white. His sliding gait had been deceptively swift, but it was as nothing to the speed at which he now ran.

792,7,7,"Dina saw a group of girls that seemed to be about her age sitting on top of a picnic table at the other end of the park. They were all turned away from her, apparently looking at something of great interest in the distance that she couldn’t make out. One sat cross-legged leaning back on her hands, her shiny hair cascading down her back. Another rested her elbows on top of her bent knees, gently picking at her nail polish. They lounged gracefully in their effortless jeans. Cool girls. 

Dina took a deep breath and squared her shoulders. She was feeling like a new woman recently– why not be a cool girl? As she walked towards them with an increasingly moisture-less mouth, she tried to decide if it was better if they noticed her approaching, or if she just appeared out of nowhere beside them. Suddenly both options seemed unavoidably and horrifyingly awkward. Luckily it didn’t seem to matter because not one of the girls turned their head so much as a fraction of an inch as Dina drew nearer. They were definitely focused on something, it seemed, but it wasn’t her. 

After what seemed like at least an hour (but must have been only a couple of minutes), Dina finally arrived at the picnic table. She had snapped some particularly crunchy twigs underfoot in her last few steps, but still nobody looked around. 

Feeling more and more panicked and insane for having put herself in this bizarre position with a bunch of strangers, Dina finally found her (suddenly very tremulous) voice. “Hi hello I’m Dina where– what are you all looking at?”

Nothing.

“Uh, I hang out here a lot but I’ve never noticed you here before, do you, uh, go to parks a lot? I mean, this one? ‘Cause like, um, like I said I haven’t seen you here and I’m here like pretty much all the time, or like, a normal amount of time.” 

Still nothing. 

Dina stared into the intricate twin braids lining the back of one of the girls’ heads. She was getting really frustrated now and could feel the nervous anticipation turning to anger in her throat. Why did these girls think they were so much better than her anyway? As if she didn’t deserve even a single moment of their precious attention? Where exactly did they get off with that– they didn’t even know her! 

Dina stormed around the picnic table to look at them– no, to force <i>them</i> to look at <i>her</i> just for one minute, and to listen. But when she came around to the other side of the table she stopped dead. Her mouth hung open and had gone bone dry once more. 

Standing on that side of the table, she stared in horror at that same pair of intricate twin braids. The girls hadn’t moved– Dina hadn't taken her furious gaze off of them– yet somehow she was looking at the back of their heads again. But their bodies were still turned towards her! It was all so grotesque and somehow she could still read the phrase on the front of one of their tshirts: <i>Say it again and I’ll pretend like I care.</i>

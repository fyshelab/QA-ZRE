She took a step forward. Three kids ahead of her now. Her goggles felt weirdly tight on her head and were pulling her hairs. Voices and laughter echoed off the walls all around her. Another big splash. Two kids ahead of her now. <i>Why am I even doing this? I could just go back to the shallow end right now. </i>But she didn’t move. She watched the girl at the top leap off the board’s edge and curl herself into a cannonball. The splash sent water running over Mei’s feet. <i>People do this all the time, right? It can’t be that bad, right? RIGHT?</i> She watched a pair of dripping feet climb the ladder in front of her. The smell of chlorine felt like it was stuck inside her nose. Another big splash. Mei’s turn.

27,11,3,,1,3.6,1.7,Laser Maze,"Mandisa stopped running just in time. She swung out her left arm and caught the others as they ran up beside her. All of them were breathing hard. They had stopped right in front of a huge field of lasers. Thin beams of red light shot in every direction as far as the eye could see. 

“What is this place?” asked Fatima.

Mandisa looked around, trying to catch her breath. The room they were in was like a long, strange hallway. The ceiling was very low. All of the walls and floors were tiled with some smooth, shiny black material like glass. There was no way through the hall except to go through the lasers. She could hear the low buzzing hum they made.

Femi seemed to have noticed their problem too. “What do you think would happen if we touch them?” she said, looking at the red beams.

“Worst case they burn a hole through us.” Mandisa said. “Best case they set off some kind of alarm to tell everyone where we are. Either way I don’t want to find out.” But then Mandisa noticed a gap between the beams right in front of her. There was a narrow path through. She stepped into the gap and the others gasped. Now she could see other open paths through the lasers on either side of her. “It’s a maze,” she said.

“What?” said Fatima. “We can’t go through there! What if we choose the wrong way? We could be trapped!”

“We don’t have any choice,” Mandisa said. “They’re coming.”

30,10,3,,1,3.6,2.5,Outhouse Hangouts,"It was Li’s first time at summer camp, and so far it was okay - except for the bathroom. The bathroom wasn’t really a bathroom at all - it was an outhouse! You had to walk through the forest to get to it, and it was dark and smelly and full of spiders. Li’s least favorite time was when she had to go at night. The walk through the forest seemed twice as long. The outhouse was twice as dark. And at night, it probably even had twice as many spiders in it!

These were Li’s thoughts as she walked down the path her second night at camp. She was not looking forward to using the outhouse. And she was looking forward to it even less when she got there and heard a weird noise coming from inside. It sounded like a wailing ghost!

Li waited a bit, but she didn’t hear the noise again. Finally she decided she would just have to brave it. After all, it was already full of spiders. A ghost could hardly make it worse. Li took a deep breath (but not too deep, because of the smell) and opened the door.

Inside was a girl! Li looked carefully, but she didn’t seem to be a ghost. In fact, she looked like one of the girls in Li’s cabin. She also looked like she had been crying.

“I h-h-hate it here,” the girl said.

“I hate it in the outhouse too,” said Li. “But the cabin is much better.”

“No, I mean I hate it at camp!” the girl said. “I never make friends. There are so many other girls. I always feel like everyone is watching me and waiting for me to do something silly. This is the only place I feel safe.”

Li thought for a minute. “Would it help if we became friends?” she said. The girl looked at her. Then she sniffed and nodded.

“Okay. One one condition,” said Li. “I’m never hanging out in the outhouse again!”

Noah’s door is round and silver and shiny. Your room might be filled with toys. Noah’s room is filled with beeping and flashing machines. This is because Noah is an alien! He lives on a spaceship. Once, Noah saw a picture of a room just like yours. He thought it looked pretty weird. “Where are the beeping machines?” he said. “Why is the door a rectangle?”

34,5,3,,4,3.7,2.9,The Proud King,"In a far away land, in a far away time, there lived a proud old king. The king was <i>so</i> proud that he believed that he controlled the moon and the sun. He loved to shout about his powers from the castle’s tallest towers.

“The moon only shines because I make it so!” he cried to knights and servants. “The sun only rises each day on my orders!” 

People always nodded politely. It was not wise to argue with the king. Then, one day, a wandering jester came to the kingdom. Right away he heard the king’s bragging. It made him laugh. So, he went to the castle wall and called up to the king.

“If you can make the sun rise and the moon shine,” he yelled, “then why don’t you just prove it?”

“Come on! Just hear me out,” he said.

Selena crossed her arms and looked at him. “Okay,” she sighed. “Tell me about this great invention of yours.”

Alfy grinned and spun his chair to face her. He spread out his arms on either side of him dramatically. “Rocks!” he cried. “I call it the If-Rocks-Could-Talk-Project!”

Selena raised her eyebrows. “Rocks?” she said. “Talking rocks? Alfy, I love you, but I think your head is full of rocks.”

“Just think about it!” he said. “Rocks are just about the oldest things on Earth. If we had some way of talking to them, imagine what they could tell us! They could tell us about the beginning of the planet! They could tell us about creatures we never even knew were real! They could tell us about the world’s most ancient people and how they lived! They could tell us everything!”

Selena looked interested now. “I guess it’s not a totally wacko idea,” she said. “But still, rocks aren’t alive, Alfy! They can’t even talk to each other, let alone us. There’s no way you’ve made a gadget that can do that.”

Alfy’s eyes twinkled with excitement. “But I have!” he said. “Or, at least I’m pretty sure that I have. I really really think my invention is going to work. I just need your help to test it!”

39,11,3,,1,3.9,2.4,Sunlight Eaters,"Simon stared at the alien that sat on the metal table in the lab. It looked like an upside down jujube with a mouth. It didn’t have any eyes, but it’s wide mouth was smiling. It jiggled happily back and forth making odd squeaks. 

Professor Dinkluss looked at the strange creature and scratched his chin. “Well, I’ve done some tests,” he said. “And a few things are clear now.” He waved at Simon to come closer.

“I...think I’m okay back here for now. Thanks,” said Simon. 

“Suit yourself,” said the professor. He went on. “The first thing was to find out what it eats. That was not as easy as it might sound.”

“Picky eater, huh?” Simon said. 

“Exactly,” replied the professor. “I tried feeding it meat: steak, jerky, ham, spam, burgers, sushi. Nothing. No interest. Then I tried vegetables and fruits: broccoli, sprouts, raspberries, bananas. It sucked on a turnip for a while, but then spit it out. I tried blue cheese, and cotton candy, fried eggs, and chewing gum. I tried grass and tree bark and metal nails and nail polish. None of it was any good.” He smiled. “But then I finally figured it out.”

“So, what does it eat then?” Simon asked.

“Sunlight.” the professor said simply.

“Sunlight? How is that possible? No creature can <i>eat</i> sunlight!” Simon said.

“Oh no?” said the professor, curling an eyebrow. “Can’t you think of some living creatures on our own planet who do just that? Who use sunlight as their main source of energy to grow?”

Simon frowned, thinking. Then with a jolt, he realized. 

“Plants!” he cried. “Plants are sunlight eaters too!”

43,4,3,,4,3.9,2.0,Prince of Trash,"There was a prince from a different land in Tyrell’s bedroom, and the prince was not happy. “I am a prince!” he yelled. “I command you to bring me all the best things!” 

Tyrell looked nervously at the door. What if someone heard? He didn’t know how he’d explain the magical portal the prince came through, or the other lands, or the prince himself, who had sparkly skin and purple hair. 

“Shhh,” Tyrell said. He sat the prince on his fluffiest pillow. 

“You expect a prince to sit on a pillow?” the prince yelled. “In my land, princes only sit on the floor!” He sat down on the floor. 

“Okay, okay,” Tyrell said. He snuck out, and brought back the prince some juice in his mom’s fanciest cup. 

“NO!” the prince screeched. Tyrell stopped him from throwing the cup at the last minute. “In my land, princes only drink water! Out of dirty tin cans!” 

This land sure sounds weird, Tyrell thought. He looked around, trying to find something the prince would like. In the corner were his oldest, smelliest socks. They had holes in them. They were grey. And they smelled really bad. He handed them to the prince. The prince took a long sniff of the socks. Slowly, he pulled them onto his purple feet. Tyrell watched nervously. Then, “These...are...AMAZING!” screamed the prince. It seemed he had got what he wanted: the portal opened up again behind him, and he jumped through. Tyrell got one last whiff of the socks, and then the prince was gone.

46,4,4,,1,4.0,2.4,La Petite Souris,"The tooth fairy sighed. She still had more than sixty teeth to collect, and it was already past midnight. She flapped her tiny, tired wings and flew across the quiet streets. On one side she carried a bag full of coins. On the other was her bag full of baby teeth. The bags brushed the windowsill as she flew into the next child’s bedroom.

But what she saw inside made her stop suddenly in mid-air. What was this? There was already someone pulling a tooth out from under this child’s pillow! It couldn’t be another fairy - they had no interest in teeth. That was her job! She flew closer.

It was a little brown mouse. As she watched, it pulled a coin out of its mouse-sized backpack and pushed the money under the pillow. Then it carefully put the tooth in the backpack and zipped it up.

The tooth fairy couldn’t stand it anymore. She was supposed to be collecting that tooth! “What are you doing?” she said, in a whisper that was more of a shout.

The mouse looked up. “Oh, I’m sorry, are you here for the tooth?” it said. “You see, I’m the French tooth fairy. And this child is French. So this is actually <i>my</i> job.”

“But...but this is my area! I’m supposed to collect that tooth!” the tooth fairy said. She flew slowly down to the bed beside the child’s pillow.

The mouse shrugged its tiny mouse shoulders. “But this is a French tooth,” it said.

The tooth fairy couldn’t think of anything to say to that. The two small tooth fairies stared at each other. Then the child turned over in its sleep and broke the spell. The mouse ran smoothly up the desk to the window. The fairy flew up after it. They both stood on the windowsill for a moment, looking out at the moonlit night.

“Actually - can I ask you where you got that backpack?” the tooth fairy said finally. “These bags are really heavy and hard to fly with.”

“Oh! Of course!” said the mouse.

And just like that, they were friends.

People say that the Coat Woman lives deep in the dark forest. Some people say she lives in the heart of a tree. Others say that she sleeps under the river. Only a very few souls have actually seen her. Or at least, only a few have been able to come back and tell about it.

She is tall. Very tall, for a woman (if that is what she is). She has dark glossy hair. The top half of her face is as pale as the moon. Nobody has ever seen the bottom half. It is always covered by the large collar of her great and mysterious coat. 

She is never seen without the coat. It seems to be too big for her. It falls all the way down to her feet and drags on the ground behind her. The sleeves are wide and sweeping. It is always said to be made of some thick, heavy material, but the color is disputed. Some people say the coat looks dark and soft like moss. Others say it is as pale and layered as the fog. One rare tale tells of the coat glowing like the light reflecting off a cat’s eye in the night.

But what is on the outside of the coat is less troubling than what lies on the inside. Some people think she has no body at all. The woman never speaks, but strange sounds come from under that coat: the calls of birds that don’t exist, the howling of strong winds, a chime that reminds you of something you lost in childhood. Nobody knows what is under her coat. Nobody wise wants to know. So if you ever see her in the deep, dark forest, don’t let your curiosity get the best of you. Or else the Coat Woman might get the best of you too.

59,5,4,,1,4.3,2.7,Fisherman's Riches,"There once was a man who lived by the sea. He was a poor and honest fisherman. One day he was out fishing in his small boat. Suddenly, he felt something large tugging on his fishing line. Slowly and carefully he reeled it in. With a great pull he lifted it into the boat. It was a gigantic fish! It was like nothing he had ever seen before! It had sparkling rainbow scales and a long swishing tail. 

The fisherman was so happy! When he sold this fish in the market, he would be rich!

But then the fish looked up at him and said, “Please, good fisherman. Do not take me from my home in the water. It is not yet my time to go!”

The fisherman looked back at the fish. The fish looked very sad. The fisherman knew that the fish was right: it was not his time to go. So, the fisherman gave up his dreams of riches with a sigh. Then he threw the fish back into the water.

“Thank you so much!” cried the fish as it splashed down beside the boat. “For your kindness I will always owe you a favor. And I will be glad to give it to you when the time comes.” Happily, the fish swam away.

Many years passed and the fisherman got older. One day he was out on his boat when a storm suddenly hit. The sky went dark and the wind started howling. The fisherman wasn’t strong enough row against the large waves. His eyes weren’t clear enough see the shore. 

Then suddenly the rainbow fish appeared! Its head popped out of the water beside the boat and it said: “Hello again, kind fisherman! I have not forgotten that you saved my life all those years ago. Now it is my turn to help you!”

And so the fish pulled the fisherman in his boat all the way back to shore. When he was safely back on land, he waved his thanks to the fish. The fisherman and the fish became great friends, for the rest of their lives. And that was all the riches they needed.

60,7,5,,1,4.4,2.6,No-Mouth Nightmare,"Ari is having the dream again. The worst dream of all. It’s the dream where she is standing in front of the whole class, about to give a presentation. The teacher is waiting for her to talk. The whole class is waiting for her to talk. But she can’t seem to start. Just like always, Ari looks to her left and sees the teacher. The teacher looks impatient. Just like always, Ari looks out at the class. Some of them also look impatient. Some of them look like they think it’s funny. Some of them just look bored. Why can’t she start talking?

Ari tries to open her mouth, but it won’t open. She raises her hand to her mouth - but there’s nothing there. It’s just a smooth stretch of skin where her mouth should be. Now Ari is really scared. This isn’t how the dream normally goes! Usually she wakes up by now. She tries to say something, but only a muffled sound comes out. She looks out at the class again. Now they all have only one look: terrified. She realizes that all of their mouths are growing over with skin. The teacher struggles and grabs her face, but it doesn’t help: she can’t say a word either. One girl at the back of the class lets out one last scream before her mouth is gone completely.

It’s that scream that wakes Ari up. She lies there for a second, breathing heavily. What a bad dream! She puts her hand to her mouth, to make sure everything is back to normal. And that’s when she starts trying to scream for real - but nothing comes out…

61,7,4,,1,4.4,2.5,Kitchen Witch,"Sierra sat in her room upstairs. Her big sister was at a friend’s house. Her parents were out. It was dark outside, and the branches of the big trees in the backyard tapped on the window. But Sierra was old enough to stay home alone. That meant she was brave enough to stay home alone too.

Then she heard a noise downstairs.

“Rrrrreeeeeennnnnnnh.”

It sounded like a monster. No - a witch! A screaming, creepy witch.

“RrrreeeEEENNNnnnnh.”

Sierra turned up her music and tried to ignore it. But it cut through the comforting sounds.

“RrrEEEENNNNNH.”

It sounded like it was coming from the kitchen.

Sierra got up all her courage. She turned off the music and cracked open her bedroom door. The house was quiet. Could she have imagined it? She crept into the hallway. It was dark, but a single light from the kitchen glowed at the bottom of the stairs.

“RrrreennnNNNNhhhh!”

Sierra jumped! There was definitely a witch down there in the kitchen. She had thought she was too old to believe in witches, but this was proof they existed. Nothing else could be making a noise like that. Sierra could picture the witch perfectly. She knew it would be crouched in the corner, beside the counter. It would have black robes and a horrible, warty nose. And it would reach out its crooked, bony fingers towards her…

Sierra took a deep breath. No matter what, the witch was going to get her. But she had to see it first. She tiptoed very, very quietly down the stairs. The yellow light glowed through the railing. Slowly, the kitchen came into view. The tile floor...no witch yet. The microwave...still no witch. The dishwasher, the counter, the corner…

Sierra stopped, still crouched on the stairs. Where was the witch? Was it invisible? Had it magically moved behind her? Was she about to feel those bony fingers on her shoulder?

“RRRRREENNNNNNNHHHHH!”

Sierra screamed! Then she stopped. Because even though the noise sounded louder and even more horrible up close, it wasn’t coming from a witch.

“Reennh. Rreennh. Clack. Clang. Sploosh. Sploosh.”

It was just the old, creaky dishwasher, finishing washing a load of dishes.

62,7,4,,4,4.4,3.2,The Dollhouse,"The dollhouse sat alone on the sidewalk corner. Jamal got off his bike and walked towards it. There was no moon that night and it was dark. The <i>tik-tik-tik</i> of the bike wheel was the only sound on the street.

The house had only three sides so that he could look right into it. It had three floors and lots of little rooms. The outside was dirty and scratched but the inside was shiny and looked brand new. Jamal had never played with a dollhouse before. He leaned in closer to look at the little kitchen and the little bedroom. He liked the tiny lamps. He liked the tiny fridge with the even tinier fridge magnets. He slowly reached out a finger to touch a tiny milk jug– but then he heard people whispering. He turned quickly but saw no one. He was alone on the street. 

Jamal turned back towards the dollhouse. One of the tiny lamps was glowing with a soft, yellow light. Had that light been on before? The whispering began again. Suddenly Jamal wanted to have this dollhouse more than anything in the world. He needed to have it. It was his.

63,10,4,,4,4.4,3.1,Not Boring At All,"William was allergic to just about everything. He couldn’t have peanut butter, and he couldn’t roll in the grass. He couldn’t eat at most restaurants, and he had to sleep with a special machine to filter the air in his room. Normally, that stuff didn’t bother William. He was used to it. But there was one big problem. He couldn’t have pets! He was allergic to cats, to dogs, to hamsters and even to birds. Mama Jules was scared of snakes, and Mama Steph said no to a pig. “Just a small one!” said William, but she said you never know how big they’d grow. 

That weekend, William told his aunt his problems. “I have just the thing for you,” she said. “Hop in the car.” They drove right past the pet store and into the suburbs. 

“Aquarium store?” said William when they stopped. “Aren’t fish kind of boring?” 

“Wait and see,” his aunt said, holding open the door. 

Inside there were tanks from floor to ceiling. There were more fish than William had ever seen - and they weren’t boring at all! They came in every color and every size and every shape. 

“Whoa,” said William.

67,4,4,,1,4.5,3.1,Teegy of the Geegersneegers,"Marcus was walking through the forest singing to the butterflies. Suddenly, he heard a noise in the bushes behind him. He turned around to find the strangest creature he had ever seen. The creature looked sort of like a very small old man. It had thin limbs and pale greyish skin. Its head was wider than a normal person’s, and its large eyes were a deep, glittering purple. Oddly enough, the creature did not seem to walk on its feet. Its scrawny arms held up its body while its legs were crossed and twisted like a pretzel behind its head. But strangest of all were the toenails growing from those feet: they were yellow, and jagged, and so long that they curled into spirals at the ends!

“What are you lookin’ at?” the thing growled at Marcus.

“Nothing!” Marcus replied at once. “I’ve just never seen a creature like you before.”

“Oh yeah?” it said. “We’re a rare kind. The world can’t handle too much of a beautiful thing, you know.” It carefully dug around in one nostril with the tip of a gnarled toenail.

“I...I guess not.” said Marcus. He turned to leave.

“You can call me Teegy,” the creature said, shuffling towards Marcus. He proudly extended a filthy, lumpy foot. (Marcus was relieved it wasn’t the foot with the booger still hanging off the end.) “Teegy of the Geegersneegers.”

Marcus looked at the foot and swallowed. A bad, sweet smell like rotting fruit was coming from it. Still, he took the foot in his hand and shook it, trying to smile. “Um, it’s nice to meet you, Teegy. I’m Marcus the Wanderer.”

“So you put two socks into the dryer, but only one sock comes out,” she said.

Christopher nodded. “That’s right. But you never know for sure that one is missing until you sort them.”

“Right,” said Christina. “You go to make your pairs and wind up with one red sock and one blue sock at the end.”

“Right,” said Christopher. “So is the other blue sock turning red? Or is the other red sock turning blue? Or are two of the socks just disappearing altogether? It’s madness!” he shouted.

“It is madness,” Christina agreed. “People have been losing socks in the laundry since the beginning of time!” She thought about that. “Or at least since the sock was invented! It’s the biggest unsolved mystery in the history of the world!”

“Well we’re gonna solve it!” Christopher said, standing up too. “All we have to do is keep each other on our <i>toes</i> and put our best <i>foot</i> forward!” Christina rolled her eyes.

It made a soft <i>thunk</i>. She did it again and added in the second foot. <i>Thunk thunk</i>. She began tapping them back and forth, building up a rhythm until she heard a small cough from beside her. 

The only other person at the bus stop was a man with a newspaper. He looked old, like her daddy, but not as old as Grandpa. He was wearing an expensive suit with dark striped pants. As Moira looked at him he gave her a stern look over his newspaper. He didn’t say anything but eventually turned the page and went back to his reading.

“What are you waiting for, Mister?” Moira asked him.

“I beg your pardon, young lady?” he replied.

“I’m just wondering what you’re waiting for,” she said. “It’s a real hot day to just be sitting around in the sun like this. Like, just for fun or something.” 

“This is a bus stop,” he said, keeping his eyes on his newspaper. “I am waiting for the bus.”

Moira stopped staring at him and started pulling at a loose thread on her dress. “It just looks to me like you might be some kind of rich, fancy type of business person or something. People like that don’t usually take the bus.”

The man folded his paper down and looked at her. “Young lady, did you know that it’s rude to ask how much money someone has?”

“I wasn’t asking!” Moira replied, trying to look shocked. “I just said what it <i>looks</i> like, and I think I’m right. Anyway, all I really meant was that you can wait for all kinds of stuff at a bus stop. Just because busses stop here doesn’t mean that nothing else does.”

The man considered this. “Yes, I suppose you’re right. What are you waiting for, then?” he asked.

“Well,” Moira said, standing up and shading her eyes with her hand, “I’m waiting for an adventure!”

""If you keep being naughty, you’re going to wind up in the house at the end of the lane,” his Oma would say, when he knocked over her paint pots. ""Where did you come from - the house at the end of the lane?” his Opa would say, if Eli ran too fast and bumped into him. And once, late at night before Eli went back home from Oma and Opa’s house, his Oma said quietly, ""Your mother went to the house at the end of the lane, you know. And she never came back.”

""That’s silly, Oma!” said Eli. ""She’s picking me up tomorrow at the airport!”

""Of course, my pet,” said his Oma, and she hugged him tight and sent him to bed. The next day at the airport, Eli looked into his mother’s dark eyes, but everything seemed normal. His mother smiled her sharp-toothed smile and hugged him tight and took him home, and Eli forgot all about it.

The next summer when he was back at his Oma and Opa’s, it was a hot, boring day and Eli felt restless. He answered rudely when his Opa asked him a question, and shrugged when his Oma asked if he’d like to watch her paint. ""What is this, the house at the end of the lane?” his Oma said. ""I think you need to go play outside.” She pinched his cheek, so Eli knew she wasn’t really angry, but it just made him more annoyed. He slammed the door as he left, and scuffed his feet in the dirt behind the apartment building. When he looked up, he saw the house.

It was at the end of the lane, just like he’d been told. There were boards across the windows and the door creaked as he opened it. Inside, it was cool and dark and very quiet. There was a long hallway, with closed doors all along it. When Eli walked down it, his feet left footprints in the dust. At the end of the hallway was a tall mirror.

""I’m not afraid,” Eli said out loud. He reached a hand up and wiped the dust off the mirror. His reflection stared out at him. Then he saw a dark shape over his shoulder. Before he could turn around, he felt a strong push on his back, and he fell headfirst towards the mirror.

Eli scrambled to his feet. He was on the other side of the mirror, trapped in a tall box. Standing in the hallway looking in at him was his reflection - but something was different. Eli slapped his hand on the mirror, and his reflection didn’t move. He shouted, and his reflection smiled. It had dark eyes and pointy teeth. It turned and walked down the hallway, through the door and out into the light.

“Did you put blue food coloring in the goldfish bowl yesterday morning?” he asked.

“No,” Jasmine replied. “Why would I do something stupid like that?”

“I don’t know,” Ezra said, pacing back and forth in front of her. “Maybe because Mr. Pondscum saw you pick your nose that one time. Maybe because you didn’t get to name him ‘Sir Swimmy Fins’ like you wanted. Or maybe because you just don’t like fish.”

“You’re crazy,” Jasmine said. “I don’t care about that fish one way or the other. Him or his ugly name. As far as I’m concerned he is just another decoration in the classroom.”

“Then maybe you think the classroom could do with a bit more blue in it?” Ezra asked, leaning in close.

“No, that’s not what I mean. I mean that I don’t really like Mr. Pondscum that much, but I don’t want anything bad to happen to him either. I’m sure he’s very upset that he’s been turned all blue.” She paused. “It’s not a good color for him.” And with that Jasmine walked off into the playground.

One evening Abbatha was standing on the windowsill, sweeping. Then, along came a wicked old man. All at once he plucked Abbatha from the windowsill, put her in his coat pocket, and hurried away.

King Minos was angry at them and was holding them prisoner. But Daedalus was a very creative man. He spent all day thinking of ways to escape.

One day Daedalus looked up at some birds flying by and got an idea: wings! If they had wings, they could fly off the island! So Daedalus collected all the bird feathers he could find. Then he stuck the feathers together with wax to make wings. At last he strapped one pair of wings to Icarus, and one to himself. He told Icarus not to fly too close to the sun or else the wax would melt. Icarus agreed. So Daedalus and Icarus flapped their wings and flew into the sky!

They flew higher and higher! They were free at last! The water sparkled below them. The wind felt fresh on their faces. Icarus was having so much fun, he never wanted to stop! Daedalus warned Icarus to slow down. But Icarus didn’t listen. He kept flying higher and higher. But soon Icarus found himself too close to the sun! It was too hot! The wax began to melt! The feathers fell off! Icarus could feel himself falling. He tried to flap his arms but it was too late. Icarus fell back down into the sea with a loud SPLASH!

87,2,4,,1,4.8,3.0,Sleeping Brains,"Even when the rest of your body is asleep, your brain is still hard at work! That’s because your brain needs to get ready for the next day. While you sleep, your brain helps renew your whole body. It works to make your memory stronger. It also makes space to learn new things when you wake up! When you sleep, your brain is in one of two modes: “deep sleep” or “dreaming sleep.”

Most of the sleeping we do is in the deep sleep mode. We must go through the deep sleep mode before we get to dreaming sleep. When your brain is in deep sleep mode, your muscles are relaxed and your breathing is slow. This helps your whole body and brain recharge.

When we are in dreaming sleep mode, the brain becomes very active again. This is when your dreams happen! In dreaming sleep mode, your breathing and heart rate often speed up. Scientists are understanding more and more about how this part of sleep works. But, they still don’t understand <i>why</i> it happens! Why do we have dreams at all? It’s a mystery! Can you dream up an answer to that question?

The Greeks built a gigantic wooden horse. It was beautiful on the outside. But it was hollow on the inside. That’s because a bunch of sneaky Greek soldiers were hiding inside of it! The rest of the Greeks sent a message to Troy. They said they were ready to give up and stop fighting. They said they had a gift to share with the people of Troy as a sign of friendship. So the Greeks rolled their giant wooden horse up to the gates of Troy and left it there.

The Trojans came out to see their present. It looked like a pretty nice huge wooden horse to them. And the Greeks were nowhere to be seen! So the Trojans opened the gates and rolled the horse into the city. As the people of Troy slept that night, the Greek soldiers crept out of their hiding place. They climbed out of the horse and opened the gates of Troy from the inside! Soon all the other Greek soldiers joined them and they finally defeated the Trojans!

100,10,5,,3,5.2,4.5,Loosey-Goosey-Lulu-Stucy,"Lulu Stucy was a pretty laid-back gal. She was curious and she loved to explore. Sometimes she’d get distracted by the call of a strange bird or the swirling pattern in a rock and completely forget where she was going. But she didn’t mind, and that’s why everybody called her Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy. It was also because Lulu had a habit of losing things.

“You’d lose your head if it wasn’t screwed on!” Grandma Lucy Stucy was fond of saying to her. And Lulu never used to mind losing things either, until one day she woke up and just didn’t want to be Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy anymore. She went downstairs and told her older brother Brucey all about it.

“OK,” Brucey Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “I hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

Lulu was wearing a skirt that day and didn’t have any pockets, so she just held the quarter tight in her hand. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to that weird dark stairwell behind the cafeteria, and back to the classroom. But as she was walking home at the end of the day, she looked in her hand and realized the quarter was gone!

“Oh no!” Lulu cried. “I must have put it down somewhere and forgot to pick it back up!”

But the next day her brother gave her a second chance. “OK,” Brucey Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “This time I <i>rinky</i>-<i>dinky</i>-hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

Lulu made sure to wear jeans with pockets that day, so she slipped the quarter into her pocket and forgot all about it. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to the big room with all the blue mats in it beside the gym, and back to the classroom. But as she was walking home at the end of the day, she looked in her pocket and realized the quarter was gone!

“Oh no!” Lulu cried. “There’s a hole in my pocket and I didn’t know! The quarter must have fallen right through!”

But the next day her brother gave her a third chance. “OK,” Brucy Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “This time I <i>winky</i>-<i>finky</i>-rinky-dinky-hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

This time Lulu wasn’t taking any chances. She opened her backpack and slipped the quarter into a pouch, inside a pocket, zipped up the whole thing and then buckled the flap. Feeling confident, she forgot all about it. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to the water fountain on the third floor that shot water up your nose, and back to the classroom. As Lulu was walking home along a stream, she noticed a feather on the ground of a kind she had never seen before. She took off her backpack to put the feather inside, but just then her hand slipped and the bag went tumbling down into the stream.

When Lulu got home she was so sad that she could barely hold her head up. “What’s the matter?” asked her brother, Brucey.

“I lost my backpack AND the quarter,” Lulu sniffed. “I’m gonna be Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy forever.”

Brucey looked at her. “You know, nobody is good at everything, but everybody has some things that they’re great at. We’re all good at different things and that’s what makes us, <i>us</i>! I don’t lose things very often, but I’m so clumsy that they should call me Brucey-Stucy-Drops-The- Juicy!” Lulu laughed. “And our baby sister sure is cute, but I’m about to start calling her Whoopsie-Poopsie-Baby-Stucy!” The baby giggled in her high-chair. “And Lulu, you might lose things a lot, but you also find things that nobody else sees. Look at that cool feather in your pocket! I’ve never seen one like it!”

Lulu went over and hugged her big brother. “Thanks, Brucey,” she said.

“No problem, sis,” he replied. “Besides, maybe there is a way to stop you from losing things all the time. We haven’t tried duct tape yet!”

The piñata hung from the ceiling by a thin rope. It swung gently back and forth over the heads of the playing children. It’s blank, paper eyes stared straight ahead. But one child was not playing. The birthday girl, Ines, just stared up at the piñata, frowning. She knew what was supposed to happen on birthdays. After the cake, the party guests would gather below the piñata. Then her papa would blindfold her and hand her a bat. Then she was supposed to swing and swing until she broke the piñata and all the candy came spilling out. But Ines didn’t want to do it this year. She loved candy, of course, but it didn’t seem fair to take it. That candy was part of the piñata, and he probably didn’t like being broken open for it! What had he ever done to them, anyway? So Ines made a plan.

When Ines’ mother put the birthday cake in front of her, she made a wish and blew out the candles. Then she looked up at the piñata. The piñata was still for a moment, and then it winked at her! Her wish had come true!

The butterfly’s thin wings were soaking wet. It could not move. The little boy whispered a beautiful song to the butterfly. He sang about the wind and the clouds. Then, slowly, the butterfly began to move. It stretched its patterned wings and flew into the sky! As it flew higher and higher, it sang a beautiful song to the boy. It sang to him about the wind and the clouds.

“Are we going to the neighbour’s house?” Susan asked Scruff. But Scruff didn’t answer. Instead, Scruff just crawled under the neighbour’s porch. So Susan followed her. As Susan crawled under the porch she saw Scruff lying there– surrounded by all her kittens!

104,10,5,,1,5.2,3.9,Sneaky Snacks,"Leah loved snacks. She didn’t see why she couldn’t have them all day. But her mother was very strict about snacktime. If Leah tried to open the snack cupboard, even if her mother was on a different floor of the house, she’d somehow know! “You have to save room for dinner!” she’d say, putting away the crackers. “No candy before bed!” she’d scold, as Leah was about to sneak a chocolate bar. “Marshmallows aren’t for eating, they’re for roasting!” she’d say, twisting up the bag and putting it out of reach.

One day, Leah accidentally left a cookie in her lunch box from school. She remembered it just as she was falling asleep. She sat up in bed and very, very quietly unzipped her backpack. Then she very, very quietly opened her lunch box. Imagine that - not just a snack, but a snack after lights out! That cookie tasted better than any snack Leah had ever had. She had to find a way to do it again.

Leah started to have secret nighttime snacks every time she could. At first, she would sneak little bits of food into her room here and there. But soon she wanted more than just a snack. She wanted a feast!

It took many weeks to sneak enough food, but finally Leah had it all hidden in her room. There was chocolate and candy and cookies and chips; there were even the forbidden marshmallows. Her mother said goodnight and turned off Leah’s light. Leah was so excited she could hardly wait. Very, very quietly, she laid out her feast on the bed. Very, very quietly she took her first bite.

“Leah!” The light flicked on. There stood her mother in the doorway!

Unfortunately, his family was already too far ahead to hear him. They were practically running for the entrance, and he knew they all had big smiles on their faces. His two dads and his sister all loved the corn maze. In fact, by the time Nick got to the ticket booth, it seemed like they must have already gone in. Nick couldn’t even see them.

“Dad? Poppa?” he called. He hoped he didn’t look like a silly, lost little kid, but it was almost dark. They always did the maze together as a family! Why did they leave him behind?

“Looking for your parents and your sister, little boy?” said the person behind the ticket booth. It was someone dressed up as a witch, but to Nick it seemed like it was a more realistic costume than the people at the corn maze usually had. Their voice was creaky, and their green, pointy nose came close as the they leaned across the counter. Nick took a step back.

“They just went in - they said for you to follow,” the witch cackled, pointing into the maze.

Nick hurried in. He was sure he’d find his family just around the corner, waiting for him. But as soon as he got under the entrance arch, which said “Enter At Your Own Risk,” everything became quiet. He couldn’t hear the cars or the crowd at the food trucks, and most of all, he couldn’t hear his family. Fog closed in around his ankles. He couldn’t see through the corn walls at all. Nick shoved his hands in his pockets and pulled his hood up. He walked quickly down the path, taking turn after turn, hay crunching under his feet. Then he stopped.

They always talked late into the night when they had a sleepover. Slowly, Jeremy let his eyes close.

His friends - that was it! Jeremy’s eyes flew open again and he sat straight up in in his sleeping bag on the floor. He hadn’t woken up because of a noise - he’d woken up because of silence! Where was Matt’s snoring? And the weird whistling sound Jesse made when he was sleeping? Maybe they had both gone to the bathroom. But no - Jeremy looked over at their sleeping bags, and saw that there were definitely bodies in both of them. Bodies that seemed to be lying very, very still.

“Guys?” Jeremy said in a small whisper. Matt and Jesse’s sleeping bags didn’t move. Even though he knew he was probably imagining things, Jeremy wiggled out of his sleeping bag and crawled across to Matt, who was nearest him.

He tapped Matt’s shoulder. “Matt?”

There was no answer. Jeremy felt silly, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Kneeling beside Matt, he took both hands and carefully turned him over.

“No,” Iguana replied. “I am one cold-blooded iguana. I have hard scales and big spikes. I’m tough, I’m mean, and my heart is made of ice! I don’t feel nothin’ and I don’t need nobody!”

So, off the jaguar went to Sunny Rock without him.

Just then the sun did go behind the clouds, and Iguana’s spot became darker and shadier than ever. Behind his shades, Iguana could hardly see anything at all! Without the heat of the sun, Iguana became colder and colder until he was shivering up on his branch. 

Suddenly, Iguana heard the familiar voice of Iguana Mama calling to him. “Iguana, what are you doing up there on that cold, dark branch all alone? You’re going to freeze!”

“But, Mama,” Iguana replied, “I’m a cold-blooded iguana, just like you said! I have hard scales and big spikes. I’m tough, I’m mean, and my heart is made of ice! I don’t feel nothin’ and I don’t need nobody!”

“Oh, Iguana,” sighed Iguana Mama, “being cold-blooded doesn’t mean your heart is made of ice, and it doesn’t mean you can’t feel! In fact, it actually means you feel everything EXTRA intensely! Your body is SO sensitive that if you sit somewhere hot, your whole body gets hot, and if you sit somewhere cold, your whole body gets cold!”

“But what about my spikes?” Iguana asked. “And what about my scales?” 

“Sometimes the critters that look toughest on the outside are really the ones that are most sensitive on the inside,” said Iguana Mama. 

Iguana agreed, and the two of them went straight to Sunny Rock to warm up with all their friends. On Sunny Rock it was bright and warm, and even though he didn’t feel so cold-blooded anymore, Iguana left his sunglasses on.

119,10,5,,3,5.5,4.3,Cedarvale Hill,"They had come too far to turn back now. Aidan stood at the top of the tall hill and looked down into the park below. Everything was covered in a thick layer of icy snow. The kids playing in their bright snowsuits at the bottom looked like little wriggling gummy bears from so high up. Some were playing tag, some were throwing snowballs, and one kid seemed to have gotten his head stuck in a snow drift so that only his little kicking legs were sticking out. Aidan could see them all. It had not been easy to get here, but they were finally ready to do what they had come to do: go sledding down the biggest hill in town.

They had overcome many hurdles to reach the top of that hill. Earlier that day when his friends Tara and Jack had arrived at Aidan’s house, the idea was already brewing in his mind. 

""What should we do today?” Tara asked, sitting cross-legged and chewing on a strand of her hair. ""It’s so grey outside that I forget what the sun looks like. Do you think we’ll ever wear shorts again? I miss having a sunburn, is that normal?” She flopped backwards onto the carpet.

""I don’t know,” Jack sighed.

""No,” Aidan said, grinning at the others. ""We’re going to make history! We’re going to have an adventure! We’re going to conquer The Reckless Ridge, The Crazy-Man’s Cliff– we’re going to sled down the Cedarvale Hill!”

Tara and Jack both stared at him. The hair even fell out of Tara’s mouth. Then, slowly, they both began to smile as well, an excited look on each face.

""Yes!” Jack cried, punching the air. ""We’re going to sled down the Cedarvale Hill! We’re gonna do it! Let’s go right now! Let’s–”

That’s when the first of their troubles appeared, and it sounded like Aidan’s mom. ""Oh no you’re not.” She called matter-of-factly from some distant room in the house. ""That Cedarvale Hill is way too dangerous! No way you kids are sliding down that death trap!”

""But, Mom!” Aidan yelled back at the ceiling in the general direction of his mother’s voice. ""All we’re gonna do is–”

""Nope!” the voice interrupted him, this time seeming to come from the hall on their left. ""It’s too icy out anyway. The snow won’t even be good for sledding! It’ll be one big ice slope. No way.”

""But, MOM!” Aidan cried.

""I guess maybe your mom’s right,” Jack said quietly. ""It is super icy out there today. The whole park will be like a big lumpy skating rink.”

""I’m always right, Jack! Just like <i>your</i> mother! And smart children listen to us!” the voice replied. They heard a door close.

""How did she even hear that?” Tara whispered.

""I hear everything,” said the voice of Aidan’s mom. ""So, don’t you kids get up to any trouble.”

Looking annoyed but determined, Aidan silently signalled to the others that they should go down to the cellar. Once they were down there, they used a scrap piece of paper to write and draw back and forth until they came up with a plan: they would build a giant blanket fort in the living room and bring the family laptop inside. Then, they would start a movie playing and crank the volume way up, so that if Aidan’s mom came by, she would just think they were sitting around in there watching it. Then they would sneak out of the house through the cellar door, slide down the hill a few times, set some world records for amazing bravery, and sneak back into the house before the movie was over without anyone being the wiser! It was brilliant.

<i>Sounds like a plan! </i>Tara wrote. <i>Where do you keep your sled?</i>

And that’s when Aidan realized the big problem at the core of his brilliant scheme: he didn’t have a sled! As if she could read Aidan’s mind, Tara smacked her forehead with the palm of her hand. 

But, not ready to give up just yet, Aidan held up a finger to tell them to wait. He started poking in a cupboard in a corner of the room and returned a moment later with three black plastic garbage bags in his hand. The other two looked stunned. Jack began shaking his head forcefully. Aidan began nodding, the grin back on his face. Tara rolled her eyes. They put the plan in motion.

Once the fort was built and the movie was playing, Tara, Jack, and Aidan crept quietly back down to the cellar. They had listened for a while to hear if Aidan’s mom was onto them, but she seemed to have gone quiet. They hurried to slip on their boots and coats without making any noise. As they were about to leave, Jack began trying to signal something to both of them. He was wiggling his arms around energetically and pointing, his face going red with the effort. Aidan looked at Tara and she shrugged. Neither of them had any idea what Jack was trying to say. Jack gave up and found another piece of scrap paper:

<i>If we are going down the biggest hill in town on nothing more than a square of plastic, </i>he wrote, <i>then I think we might want some kind of body armour. Trash bags don’t steer so well.</i>

Five minutes later each one of them was wearing at least three layers of puffy winter jackets, and Jack even had an old hockey helmet on for good measure. They were finally ready.



When they reached the top of the hill Aidan looked down at all the tiny people and trees so far below them. For the first time he realized just how high up they were. He felt the bottoms of his feet go sweaty and had to swallow a lump in his throat. Tara was also looking down the slope of the hill, but the glint in her eye made Aidan think that she wasn’t having any second thoughts at all. Jack was sitting on his garbage bag, with his back to the view. He was struggling to put his mitten back on, which was hard to do through three layers of puffy jacket: the material around his arms was so thick that he could barely reach one hand to the other. He looked like an extremely fat baby. An extremely fat baby who plays hockey.

Aidan walked over to help Jack, careful not to slip on the slick ice. Just as he knelt down to help, Jack finally tugged the mitten on and punched the air with satisfaction. But the quick motion was too much, and Jack began slowly sliding backwards on his bag over the crest of the hill! Aidan reached out a hand but it was too late, he could just see Jack’s surprised face disappearing down the slope at top speed!

Aidan and Tara watched Jack all the way down the steep, icy hill. It turned out that Jack was right after all: trash bags don’t steer so well.

120,10,5,,1,5.5,4.4,The Rain Storm,"Keisha fought her way down the street through the howling wind. She kept her head bent against the pouring rain. The drawstring on the hood of her raincoat was pulled tight into a scrunchy circle around her face. Small rivers streamed over her shiny red rain boots up to the ankle. <i>There must be more water inside them than outside them at this point</i>, she thought. Below the hem of her jacket, her jeans felt heavy and suffocating. But, as she walked she felt the crisp, dry edges of the folded paper inside the waistband of her pants, and she relaxed. The letter was still dry. As long as she got out of the rain soon, there was still a chance.

She saw the entrance to the subway a block ahead of her on the left. She started to walk a bit faster. On her right she passed an old movie theatre. A large crowd of people were huddled underneath its awning staring out at her. They were silent and looked terrified to let the water touch them. Keisha waved at them, but nobody waved back. She kept walking. Two grey mice floated past her, bobbing along the street in a plastic take-out container. Finally, she reached the subway entrance.

The heavy door was in the middle of a deep puddle. Keisha had to push hard to get it to open. As the door swung open, she saw the water from the puddle go swooshing down the stairs to the platform. The wind held the door open and more water came flooding in. The stairs were now an outright waterfall, with Keisha standing boldly at its top.

121,8,5,,3,5.5,4.2,The Mystery of the Missing Cookies,"All day Elliot had been busy baking double-decker-chunky-chocolate-fudge cookies. On Monday he was going to sell them out of his locker at school for 50 cents a pop, and he was going to be rich! But all day cookies had been disappearing almost as quickly as he could bake them! Elliot questioned his brother, Jeremy, who was always jealous of Elliot’s million-dollar ideas. 

“Have you been eating all my cookies?” Elliot asked.

“Gross!” Jeremy said. “I don’t even like double-decker-chunky-chocolate-fudge cookies. I would rather eat a frog than one of those! In fact, I keep a nice slimy frog right here under my pillow. Wanna see?” Elliot moved on to his next suspect.

Elliot questioned his dad, who was overly sensitive about the kitchen ceiling getting splattered with chocolate. 

“Have you been eating all my cookies?” Elliot asked.

“No.” his dad said. “But I hope that you’ve been cleaning up as you go and that you haven’t left cookie batter everywh–” Elliot moved on to his next suspect.

Elliot had questioned his mom, who had been gardening in the backyard all day. 

“Have you been eating all my cookies?” Elliot asked.

“Of course not!” his mom said. “I’ve been working in my flower bed all day. Look, you can see the dirt all over my gardening gloves!”

Elliot didn’t know what to think. He was just about ready to give up when he saw his dog Puff sniffing at something in the hall. He went over to see what it was: a trail of cookie crumbs! Dark brown crumbly bits all in a line leading down the hall to the basement. 

“That’s good detective work, Puff! Whoever has been stealing my cookies must be down there! It looks like we’re going to solve the Mystery of the Missing Cookies once and for all!”

So, Elliot and Puff crept down the stairs into the dark basement. Elliot held onto the railing with both hands. He was careful to avoid the middle of each step so it wouldn’t creak. Puff padded down the stairs on all fours and wagged her tail excitedly. When they reached the bottom Elliot could see somebody hunched in the corner but couldn’t tell who it was. He flicked on the light switch and gasped! His very own sweet mother was standing there with chocolate smeared all over her face! Dark brown crumbs coated the fingers of her flowery gardening gloves.

She looked up at him, surprised. “Yes! Yes! It was me all along! I stole the cookies and I’d do it again! Chocolate is my weakness but I won’t apologize! Lock me up if you have to but just don’t take away my cookies!”

“Hey detective,” it said. “I know something about this case that you don’t.” The voice was rough and low. 

Jessica whipped around. A man stepped out from the shadow of a doorway. He also wore his hat low, so the moonlight only stretched across half of his face. But half a face was enough for Jessica to see who it was: Jimmy Smitts.

“That’s interesting, Jimmy,” Jessica replied. “Because it’s usually only the criminals who know more about the crimes than I do.”

When they do drink water, it stays in their bloodstream so they don’t get thirsty. But their humps are made out of fat from the food that they eat! When a camel gets really hungry, its body uses the fat in its humps like food. But if the camel goes too long without stopping for a bite, the humps will start to droop! So next time you’re in the desert, make sure to feed your camel. No self-respecting camel wants to be seen with a droopy hump!

133,9,5,,1,5.7,4.6,Arachne and Athena,"There is an ancient Greek myth about a young girl named Arachne (said like ""ah-rak-nay”), and the goddess Athena. The myth says that Arachne was very, very good at weaving. All day Arachne would spin thread into yarn with a spindle. Then all night Arachne would use a loom to weave beautiful fabrics. Arachne got so good at weaving that she began to brag about her talent. She said that nobody in the whole world could weave as well as she did– not even a god. 

This angered the goddess Athena. Athena was the Greek goddess of wisdom and crafts. She did not like to hear a human claiming to be more skillful than a goddess. So, Athena challenged Arachne to a contest. They would both create a weaving. Whoever created the best weaving would win. Whoever lost would never be allowed to use a spindle or loom again! Arachne agreed and they both began weaving.

Arachne created a beautiful fabric. She used threads of every colour. It was as soft as silk and as strong as rock. But when it was Athena’s turn, she created something incredible. Athena did not use thread to weave. Instead, she used the morning sunbeams and the fluffy white clouds. She used the green of spring fields and the blue of the sky. Of course, Athena won the contest. Arachne was very upset. She would never be allowed to weave again! 

But Athena took pity on Arachne… by turning her into a spider! That way, Arachne wouldn’t need a spindle or loom. She could still spin and weave all day as she made her webs! And that’s why we call spiders ""arachnids”– all because of the ancient Greek story of Arachne!

134,3,5,,1,5.7,4.8,Romulus,"In ancient times, there was a story about how the city of Rome was created. Most people now believe that the story was a myth. But, many ancient Romans believed that it really happened. 

The story tells of a pair of twin brothers: Remus and Romulus. The twins were the sons of King Amulius. King Amulius was the king of Alba Longa (a city near to where Rome would be). But he was afraid that his sons would try to steal his throne some day. So King Amulius threw Remus and Romulus into the river Tiber! Luckily, the twins were saved by Tiberinus, the god of the river. Tiberinus left the twins safely in a cave.

In the cave was a female wolf. But instead of attacking the children, the wolf cared for them as her own. Remus and Romulus drank the wolf’s milk. The wolf protected them as they learned and grew. When they were grown, Remus and Romulus set out to start their own city. Romulus chose the hill on which the city would stand. The city was named “Rome” in his honor. Thousands of years later, the wolf that raised Remus and Romulus is still seen as a symbol of the city. The wolf cared for the human children and gave them everything they needed– just like Rome.

Delilah was looking out at the row of blueish mountains that stretched far into the distance. Skorin was looking at his shoes and tugging little blades of grass out of the ground.

“I don’t know,” Skorin replied thoughtfully. “How can you know if they’re real or not when they’re invisible?”

“Angels aren’t supposed to be invisible all the time,” Delilah said. “My grandma used to say she saw an angel outside of her window on the night I was born. She said it was flying through the sky and covering the moon.”

Just then everything seemed to get suddenly darker.  He looked at Delilah who was looking back at him with confusion on her face. The shadow stretched wide all around them and seemed to swallow the entire hill! They looked up.

Something gigantic was floating gently through the air high above them. It was roundish and long, like a blimp– but it had a tail like a fish! It was a deep purple color and had a long spiraling horn coming out of the front. Skorin could see one humongous glassy round eye staring out from the side of its head, but he didn’t know if the thing could see him or not. It was so big that it was covering up the sun! Delilah pointed to the left to show dozens more of the creatures making their slow way across the sky behind the first.

Sprinting towards the girls’ bathroom, she kept one hand covering her mouth just in case. As she reached the door and shoved it open she thought: <i>Why does every word for throwing up make it sound like you’re actually throwing up when you say it? Hurl, barf, vomit, spew…</i>

Before she could answer herself she felt a terrible gurgling from her stomach. She wrenched open one of the stall doors and stepped inside. She stared down into the toilet water and tried to take a deep breath. <i>Gross!</i> She thought. <i>I knew I should have never let Georgia talk me into that stupid gummy worm eating contest. But Georgia can’t be feeling too great either, she must have eaten twice as many as me!</i>

Just then there was the creak of the bathroom door opening and a slam from the stall door on Esme’s right. Esme heard a small burp and bent lower to see the shoes in the next stall. Just as she thought, she saw a pair of bright blue sneakers with red racing stripes. 

""Hey Georgia,” Esme said. ""At least we’re in this togeth–” But Esme wasn’t sure that Georgia heard the rest of it over the wet splash from the next stall.

Up on top of the roof next door, two round glowing circles stood out against the darkness. Priya realized they were not stars, they were eyes. But it was too dark to see what creature the eyes belonged to. Whatever it was started to growl. Suddenly she was picturing the monsters of every campfire story she had ever heard. She imagined curved horns, and sharp teeth and long, powerful, scaly tails. Then a second pair of eyes appeared, right beside the first. These eyes were smaller, but also glowing. Then a third pair appeared beside those! 

Just then Priya’s mom came outside and flicked on the porch light. Priya looked back up at the roof and saw three plump and fuzzy raccoons sitting there. They looked down at Priya with their little bandit mask faces. The smallest one was chewing on an empty juice box. After a moment, they waddled away back into the darkness. Priya burst out laughing, but her mom didn’t understand what was so funny.

177,2,6,,3,6.5,5.7,The Water Cycle,"Did you know that the amount of water there is in the world never EVER changes? Not even by a drop, it’s true! Since the very beginning of our planet way, way, way, way, way, WAAAAY back a long time ago, we’ve had the exact same amount of water on Earth. And it has been the SAME water this whole time, just popping up in different forms! That means that the water you drink from the fountain at school could be the same water that ran through the Nile River in ancient Egypt! How is that possible, you ask? It’s all through the amazing science of the “Water Cycle”. Want to find out how it works? WATER you waiting for? Read on!

The first step in the Water Cycle is “evaporation”. Evaporation is what happens when the sun gets so hot that it heats up water all over the planet, and changes it from a liquid into steam or vapour that rises up into the air. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, rivers, ponds, puddles– even off of your own skin when you sweat! So if all that water is constantly evaporating, where does it all go? Good question!

The next step in the Water Cycle is “condensation”. Condensation is what happens when all of that steam and water vapour get together in the air and start to cool down again. When that happens, the water vapour turns back into its liquid form and becomes clouds in the sky! Have you ever seen a cloud that looked like a dragon? Or a dog? Or your Uncle Ernie with the ear hair? Well, it turns out they were all just water vapour the whole time! (Except your real Uncle Ernie, he’s a person). So now all that water is hanging out as a bunch of clouds, but how does it get back down to Earth?

RAIN! And snow! And sleet! And hail! The next step in the Water Cycle is “precipitation”, and precipitation is anything formed in clouds that falls back to Earth. Precipitation happens when so much of that water vapour gets together in one place that it becomes too heavy to keep in the clouds. Rain is water vapour falling back to Earth in its liquid form, whereas snow, hail, and sleet are all water vapour dressed up in some of its solid forms! What’s your favourite kind of precipitation? Rain is more refreshing than snow, but it’s really hard to make a rain-angel. So, is that it? Is that the final step in the cycle?

Nope– but almost! The very final step in the Water Cycle is “collection”. Collection is everything that happens to the precipitation when it actually lands back on the surface of our planet. Some precipitation falls right back into lakes and oceans and, easy-peasy, it’s ready for evaporation again. But some precipitation falls on land, and then it is collected in one of two ways: either it’s absorbed <i>into</i> the ground and becomes the water that plants drink, or it runs <i>over</i> the ground in rivers and streams until it reaches an ocean or lake once again!

So that’s it, the whole kit-and-kaboodle of the Water Cycle! It just keeps going around and around and around and around and– ok I’ll stop, I’m making myself dizzy! Now go get quenched!

182,4,6,,3,6.6,5.3,Ko and the Key,"Ko stood in Selwyn the Sorcerer’s small, cramped study. If you had asked her what she was doing, she would have told you that she was dusting a collection of rare magical gadgets which stood upon a low end-table. And she would have believed that that’s what she was doing. However, what she was <i>actually</i> doing was swiping distractedly at those gadgets with a large, poofy feather duster, not noticing that she had knocked several of them to the floor. She hadn’t noticed because her eyes were fixed on something across the room: the key.

Since Ko had left the Tuskin Forest to work for Selwyn, she had been intensely interested in that key. It was long and thin, with a round loop at the top, and a complicated little rectangular piece at the bottom. Its tiny markings looked ancient, but its golden shine made it seem newly crafted. The key sat on a small, deep blue pillow inside a rectangular glass case.  The glass case sat right in the center of Selwyn’s large wooden desk. 

Ko was truly a forest creature, and many things in her new life seemed strange to her. First of all, she was very small. The top of her tufted head barely reached higher than Selwyn’s knees. She often had to climb the many tall bookshelves to reach items at the top (more than a few glass vials had been broken this way). She was covered all over in thick, soft, bright orange fur. She found that it did not camouflage her well in this place, the way that it had when she lived in the boubadrill trees. Being unable to blend-in with the grey stones and dark wood of the sorcerer’s tower had only caused problems because of one thing: Ko was extremely curious. Her one large, round eye would often catch a flicker or glimpse of something mysterious, and she just could not resist going after it. Selwyn did not like Ko to do this, though he understood that there are many interesting and mysterious things in the home of a sorcerer.

So there Ko was, staring at the key and wondering what it was for. She thought it must be connected to the one part of the tower she was never supposed to go: the Hall of Entries. <i>But what could be hidden there? Why aren’t I allowed to see it? What purpose does the Hall have if it is always kept locked?</i> Ko found herself stepping closer to the desk. The feather duster had fallen out of her hand. <i>If the key was so important, why did Selwyn just leave it there on his desk? If doors were meant to stay locked, why was the key so easy to find?</i> Ko was standing right up against the carved desk. A reflection of the golden key shimmered in Ko’s single huge eye. <i>If I took just the tiniest of peaks, what could really go wrong? </i>Before she knew it, Ko had opened the glass box, grabbed the key, and darted from the room.

She ran down the stone staircase that sprialled around the inside of the tower walls. The key felt strangely heavy for its size. Ko could feel it tingling in her hand. She jumped from step to step until she reached a tall painted archway that marked the Hall of Entries. It was blocked off by a thick, red velvet rope tied on either side. Through the archway, Ko could see a long, long hallway lined with doors on either side. It extended so far that Ko could not see the end of it. Ko stepped under the velvet rope. She didn’t even have to duck.

Once she was inside, everything seemed very hushed. Ko looked up and saw a colourful stained-glass ceiling curving high above her. <i>THWACK!</i> A loud sound erupted from her right. She spun around and saw a small, pale wooden doorway, not much bigger than she was. An uneven pounding was coming from that door as if something angry was trying to escape from it. Ko noticed a rusted metal lock on its face. She looked down at the key in her hand and gulped. Slowly, she crept towards the door and tried the key in the lock. It didn’t fit. Ko breathed a deep sigh of relief. Backing away from the small pounding door, Ko continued down the hall. She tried the key in each door as she went. 

No matter how far she walked, it seemed to Ko that no two doors in the hall were alike. Some were so large that Ko could not even reach their locks, while others were so small Ko was sure they couldn’t possibly hold more than an idea inside. Some of the doors were square, or round, or farfingle-shaped and some seemed to change shape the longer Ko looked at them. Ko didn’t hear pounding coming from any other doors, but there were other strange sounds– and smells. One door was made out of chunks of glowing pink crystal and smelled strongly of salty sea water. Another was just a simple rectangle carved into the stone wall and covered in dust, but Ko heard the twitterings of a thousand birds just behind it. One particularly odd door was a thin mesh covering a shadowy tunnel. Ko couldn’t see what was inside, but there was a creepy high-pitched whine coming from it, and the whole thing smelled of rotten eggs. Ko tried door after door after door, but none of the locks fit the key. Until finally, Ko came to a door and just knew it must be the right one.

The door was large and circular. It was made of the same shining gold as the key and had the same strange markings carved into its face. Ko took a deep breath and put the key into the lock. The key glowed for a moment and became warm in her hand. Then the door opened.

The door swung slowly open and Ko’s fanged mouth dropped open as she saw what lay beyond. Behind the doorway, a hall extended so far that she could not see the end of it. The hall had high, curved ceilings and was lined with doors on either side.

You come upon an old abandoned dwell. There are no reveries here to buzz, bubble, squeak, or yell. Everything is quiet. You look around.

As you explore the dwell, you see evidence of all the dreams that have passed through here before: bits of colorful confetti from a Poppa Pinata or two, some old frosting from a floating eggoon, a wobbly Vorp Fort about to collapse. You notice a miraj storage and an imaginanium tank. You look inside only to find that they are both empty. All the resources that were once here have been taken by roaming spider-bots or other Dreamseekers. Just as you are about to leave this dwell and continue on your journey, something glints at you from a few feet away.

You walk over to it and find a small shiny object resting on the cloud floor, reflecting the starlight. It looks like a stone made of glass or amber. It has jagged edges like it is a broken piece of something, but you see no other pieces around you. It looks almost like a chunk of a vision core, but something is different about its color and weight. And besides, you’ve never seen a piece of vision core left lying around. You pick it up. Though it has been lying on the cool ground, it feels warm in your hand. This must be one of the mysterious shards you have heard about. They are supposed to be rare and very powerful. You slip it into your pocket and continue on your way.

188,3,6,,1,6.7,5.5,The Great Emu War,"An emu (said like ""ee-moo”) is a type of large bird that is only found in Australia. Emus have big round eyes, long necks, and cannot fly. Emus look a lot like their relative, the ostrich! Emus are very common in Australia, like huge, long-legged pigeons! In some parts of Australia, there are so many emus that they cause problems for the people who live there. Just like in the Great Emu War of 1932!

In 1932, more and more people in Western Australia were becoming farmers. These farmers mostly grew wheat. Since there were so many new farmers, some of them started farming on land that nobody had used before. When 20,000 emus came strutting back from their migration season and settled there, they realized why! Emus were all over the place! The emus liked to eat the farmers’ crops and make holes in their fences. There were so many emus that the farmers couldn’t stop them. The farmers had to ask the government for help. 

When the government saw what was going on, they sent in the military! Those emus caused so much trouble that the Australian government went to war with them! The military sent in soldiers with guns and trucks to try and get the emus off of the farmland. But the emus were too fast and too smart for the soldiers. The emus ran in small groups which made them hard to chase. The emus also started warning each other when they saw the soldiers coming. After a while, the military gave up and left. And that’s the way those big, beautiful birds won the Great Emu War of 1932!

Here and there, on other identical ledges along the cliff face, another woman stood or sat. The fiery twin moons, as familiar to her as her own spear, shone high in the sky. But– that was strange– a small black dot seemed to be hovering between them. The heat of her beloved planet made her sight shimmer. But as Khadija watched, the dot grew larger. And though one had not been seen in her lifetime, or her mother’s, or her mother’s mother’s, she knew what it was: a spaceship.

They were under attack.

199,9,6,,3,6.4,6.5,How Odin Won the Magic Mead,"It is said that long, long ago, the Dwarves brewed blood and honey together to make a powerful potion they called ""Magic Mead”. Magic Mead had the power to grant wisdom and poetry to any who drank it. Hearing of its power and wanting it for himself, a Giant called Suttung stole it from the Dwarves and hid it in a cave. To protect the Magic Mead even further, Suttung put a spell on his own daughter, Gunnlod, which forced her to remain in the cave for the rest of her life and stop anyone from stealing it. 

Odin, the eldest and wisest of the Gods, also heard about the potion and set out on a quest to collect some from the Giants. He wanted to give the Magic Mead to humankind so that their words would become wise and beautiful. First, Odin disguised himself as a poor wanderer and went to the farm of Baugi, the brother of Suttung the Giant. Odin, in his disguise, offered to work Baugi’s fields in exchange for a reward. Baugi replied that it takes nine men to work his fields, and could not be done by one man alone. Odin promised he could do it, if he would be rewarded. Baugi agreed.

Using his great power and wisdom, Odin did the work of nine men in one night. The next day Baugi was pleased, and asked what the wanderer wanted as a reward. Odin replied that he wanted a drink of the Magic Mead kept by Baugi’s brother, Suttung. Baugi went to Suttung to ask for the Magic Mead, but Suttung refused.

""You cannot give away the Magic Mead!” Suttung said to Baugi. ""It is too valuable! I have trapped my daughter in a cave just to protect it! Besides, that poor wanderer seems too powerful to be who he says he is, I do not trust him.”

Baugi returned to Odin and told him that Suttung would not let him have any of the Magic Mead. Odin reminded Baugi that he owed him a reward for his work, and so Baugi must help him enter the cave and get the Magic Mead in secret. Baugi agreed and led him to the cave where the Mead was hidden.

The entrance to the cave was blocked by stones, but Baugi used his Giants’ strength to make a small hole in the rock. Suddenly, Odin transformed himself into a snake and slipped through the hole. Baugi realized he had been tricked by the poor wanderer, but it was too late.

Inside the cave Odin heard Gunnlod, Suttung’s daughter, expressing how much she wanted to be free. ""I wish I could leave this cave,” she cried, ""but the spell my father cast on me has forced me to stay here with the Magic Mead forever!”

Odin changed back into his real form and slowly approached Gunnlod. ""If you give me the Magic Mead, I will use my great powers to lift the spell your father cast and free you from this cave!” Hesitantly, Gunnlod agreed and Odin lifted the spell. Then Odin used his wisdom to lead them both out of the cave safely. Once they reached the bright world outside, Odin gave Gunnlod a sip of the Magic Mead, and they parted ways as friends. Gunnlod sang wise and beautiful words about Odin for the rest of her life.

Families collected the honey and took care of the bees. Most bee hives were passed down from one generation to the next, and some even lasted up to 80 years! There are not many stingless bees left in the world, but some people still practice this ancient form of beekeeping today!

Have mice been stealing from your harvest? Take them to the judge! Have bugs been eating your crops? Let a jury decide! Historians say that even back then, people knew that the animals weren’t <i>really</i> criminals. Instead, people charged these animals with crimes in court so they would be allowed to get rid of them. If those mice were found guilty of stealing, it was okay for the farmer to chase them out of his fields. So, what do you think the judge said when a skunk was on trial? ""Odor in the court!”

So, it wasn’t totally surprising when he kept a bear as a pet in his Cambridge University dorm room! When Byron arrived at university, he found out that dogs were not allowed. To protest this (and make a joke), Byron went out and bought a tame bear. He brought the bear to university with him and kept it in his dorm room. When Cambridge staff tried to stop him, Byron pointed out that there was no actual university rule against bears. Eventually the university had to agree that he was right and let him keep the bear. After that Byron often took his bear for walks around the campus on a leash. He even suggested once that he would enroll the bear in classes! Byron loved animals of all kinds and had many pets during his life. Besides the bear, he also had cats, dogs, horses, a fox, monkeys, an eagle, a crow, a falcon, peacocks, geese, a badger, a heron, and a goat!

British dogs were also eager to do their part. Dogs were trained to spot far-off enemies and send messages from base to base. Soldiers slipped notes into tubes on their collars and the dogs ran back and forth delivering them. The dogs were fast and difficult to catch. Plus, they chased the rats out of the trenches!

Pigeons helped to send messages over even longer distances! They were trained to fly from Britain to the battlefields and back again. This allowed news to travel quickly both ways. The pigeons were so good at this job that the Germans even trained hawks to attack them in flight!

Millions of furry and feathered friends were also heroes of WW1!

210,5,6,,3,6.7,6.6,Shortcake,"Every year on Ibrahim’s birthday, Uncle Ali would bake him a super scrumptious special strawberry shortcake. The shortcake was so sensationally special because every year Uncle Ali baked it to be the exact same height as Ibrahim! The cake would have layers and layers of biscuit, whipped cream, and strawberries piled up to the very tip top of the birthday boy’s head!

When Ibrahim was just a little tiny baby, the shortcake was only two layers tall. Ibrahim’s mother sat him down on the counter beside the cake and Ibrahim tried to give it a hug.

A few birthdays later, Ibrahim had grown up to six years old and the shortcake had grown up to three and a half feet tall! Uncle Ali had to bake seven whole layers and hung a sign on it that said ""Must be this tall to ride”.

A few birthdays after that, Ibrahim was twelve years old and the shortcake was five whole feet tall! Uncle Ali had to buy all the strawberries in the market, and he had to stand on a chair to put the last ones on top.

But then Ibrahim really hit his growth spurt. He grew to six feet tall, and then to seven, and then to eight feet tall and there was no sign of him slowing down!

By the time Ibrahim turned sixteen, he was thirty feet tall! Ibrahim was taller than his mom and his dad and the oak tree in their yard. He was so tall that he couldn’t fit inside the house anymore! Instead, he lived in a big blue tent under the highway and waved to people in their cars on their way to work.

But Uncle Ali was still determined to make Ibrahim his special birthday strawberry shortcake. Uncle Ali went to every supermarket in town and bought every last strawberry they had. He spent three days mixing the batter and getting ready. And then he started to bake.

Uncle Ali baked layer upon layer of cake. He stacked them up as they came out of the oven: biscuit, whipped cream, strawberries, biscuit, whipped cream, strawberries. Uncle Ali stood on a chair and kept stacking. Uncle Ali stood on the table and kept stacking. Uncle Ali climbed up a ladder and kept stacking. Uncle Ali climbed onto the roof and kept stacking. But he just couldn’t get high enough! Then he had a brilliant idea.

As Ibrahim walked towards the house for his birthday party, he saw a helicopter hovering over the backyard. The helicopter had something circular hanging from it. Ibrahim got closer and peeked into the helicopter, careful not to get an accidental haircut from the spinning blades. Inside was Uncle Ali, and the thing hanging from the helicopter was a layer of strawberry shortcake!

""Uncle Ali!” Ibrahim said. ""What are you doing flying around in a helicopter?”

""Well,” said Uncle Ali, ""for a shortcake it sure is getting awfully tall!”

The tank was 50 feet tall, 90 feet around, and was holding over 2 million gallons of molasses at the time! The tank exploded when temperatures in Boston went from really cold to really hot really quickly. People all over the city heard a huge roar and rumble as the tank came crashing down. Then, an enormous 25 foot tall molasses wave swept through the streets! One report claims that a small boy got caught in the wave and surfed it to safety (landing with a mouth full of goop)! The molasses in the streets went up to people’s knees. Many buildings were destroyed. People who had been in the flood were said to look like dipped toffee apples! The molasses took weeks and weeks to clean up. For decades after, on hot days in Boston many people said that you could still smell the sweet molasses. How’s that for a sticky situation?

Senet was played with two different sets of pieces (just like chess and checkers!). Instead of dice, some historians say that the Egyptians threw sticks to move pieces around the board.

But it’s hard to know exactly what the rules of Senet were. Historians have only found texts that explain bits and pieces of the game. Imagine ripping up the instructions to a new board game and then leaving it lying around for a few thousand years! But historians also note that the rules of Senet have probably changed over time anyway. So, some people have made up their own rules to keep playing this ancient game in the modern day!

221,7,6,,3,6.8,6.9,Digging,"Every night that week Mustafa had woken up to the same sound. He would be lying still in his soft bed, when suddenly the loud <i>CLANG</i> of metal on metal would make his eyelids shoot open in a jolt. Then came the sounds of digging. The soft shuffle and hiss of dirt being spilled over dirt, again and again.

The first time it had happened, Mustafa woke up confused and on edge in the dark. Once he realized that he had just been startled out of a dream, he relaxed a little and rolled over, ready to go back to sleep. But then he heard the digging coming from outside his window. 

Mustafa’s bedroom was on the first floor of their apartment building, and its window faced out into a beautiful gated courtyard. All the other apartment buildings looked into that courtyard and it was filled with trees, and flower beds, and wooden benches. During the daytime, the courtyard would be filled with little kids running around, and older folks sitting in the shade to read. But at night it was filled with nothing but shadows, and the tall black metal gates that surrounded it were firmly shut, chained, and locked.

At first Mustafa just lay there on his side, gazing out of his window, listening. He had never heard more than the mewling of a cat in the courtyard at night, and this was definitely no cat. From where he lay, he could just see the sharp pointed black tips of the gate glinting in the silvery moonlight, and all of the dark, dark night sky beyond. The sound of the digging continued steadily: a jab, a muffled patter of dirt, a low whispering sound as it scattered and slid.

Mustafa knew Joseph, the man who tended the trees and gardens in the courtyard. He knew that Joseph obsessed over his gardens, and only ever dug in them during the day because he believed that plants liked peace at nighttime, just like people. He also knew that Joseph was the only person with the keys to the courtyard gate. So, who was this digging in the courtyard in the middle of the night? And what were they digging for?

Mustafa no longer felt like going back to sleep. He didn’t think he could have if he tried. His heart was starting to beat a little louder in his chest, and he noticed that the hand gripping his blanket was sweaty. Slowly, he pulled the blankets back and slid out of his bed. He crawled across the floor to the window, not wanting his head to be seen. He paused just below it and crouched, listening.

<i>Jab, patter, whisper; jab, patter, whisper</i>– was it getting faster? Mustafa took a deep breath, held it, and inched his head up to peer through the bottom of the window. 

Fifteen feet from where Mustafa knelt, through the gate and across the grass was a large pit in the ground. Mounds of black earth were piled all around it, and a vivid orange glow was coming from its unseen depths. Closest to Mustafa were a couple of objects covered in dirt. The first was a large tattered book, leather-bound, but too filthy to read the title of. The other was a headdress of some kind, or a crown. Its metal was carved with detailed markings and it had jewels or stones embedded all across its surface. As Mustafa stared out at it, his widening eyes reflecting both the pale moon and the strange orange light, he finally let out his breath in a gasp as he realized: set into the crown were not jewels, or stones, but hundreds and hundreds of human teeth.

Suddenly a slow creaking sound rose up from the bottom of the pit and Mustafa ran back to his bed and jumped under the covers. Turning his back to the window he tried to steady his breath which was coming hard and fast. He tried closing his eyes, willing himself to go back to sleep and awake to find this had all been a terrible dream, but every time his eyelids closed the image of the crown was there waiting for him. Even under the blankets on that warm night, Mustafa lay there shivering for a long time before he finally fell asleep.

The next morning Mustafa rose slowly, sitting up and letting the smoky scent of bacon wash over him pleasantly before even opening his eyes. Once they were open, he blinked dully at a shadow on his wall, a shadow cast by the pointed tips of the metal courtyard gate.

And suddenly, with a feeling like an icy stone falling into his stomach, he remembered. Nearly tripping over his own feet in his hurry to reach the window, when he got there he breathed a deep shuddering sigh of relief. He even let out a little laugh. 

Looking out into the sunny courtyard, everything was just as it should be. A man with a coffee cup was on a bench reading a magazine. A woman and her small daughter were having a tickle fight under a large oak tree. No pit. No orange light. No crown. 

<i>What a terrifying dream that was! </i>Mustafa thought to himself. <i>I’ve really gotta cool it on those late-night movies Mom hates. Maybe there is such a thing as too-vivid an imagination.</i>

And he went to go have breakfast with his family.

That night Mustafa yawned and leaned back into his pillows, already wondering what his dad might be making for breakfast the next day when he gently drifted off to sleep. 

Then he heard a <i>CLANG</i>, followed by the unmistakable sounds of digging.

Krista took half a step forward, with a hand to her forehead to shield her eyes from the direct sunlight. Lou stood staring with her head slightly tilted and her eyes crinkled against the glare. 

It was difficult to tell whether there was anything there to see at all. They could feel the presence of something, some enormous something, but trying to look at it was like trying to see rain in the dark, or looking through a perfectly clear glass window on a bright day. But just then a gentle shiver seemed to ripple through the air itself, the way the road looks wibbly when the sun is scorching, and they knew the ship was still there.

Krista glanced back at her sister and smiled, then set off towards the center of the field. Lou followed. As they got closer, the shape of the ship came into clearer focus. It was almost the exact shape of a boat’s sail when it’s inflated by the wind, but had only a large, smooth sphere at its base. The whole structure was at least fifty feet taller than the tallest tree they could see. Standing beneath it, it seemed to be as big as the whole sky.

Krista opened her mouth, looking scared for the first time that day. ""Lou, I think–”

But just then, a shimmering staircase appeared before them leading up into the belly of the ship. Lou could hear the twittering of sparrows in some distant tree. Everything felt very still. Lou took Krista’s hand in her own, feeling the calluses of all that summer’s tree climbing and bike riding against her fingers, and led them up the staircase.

When they reached the inside of the ship, at first everything was dark. Then two glowing orbs of white light began to slowly pulse and grow until they had reached the size of basketballs. After that, other glowing objects began lighting up, one by one, all around them. They were all different shapes and sizes, and the colours reminded Lou of the tropical fish aquarium she had been to once on a field trip. Eventually it was light enough to see that they were standing in the middle of a gigantic room full of these strange, lumpy, glowing shapes, and that the ceiling above them was covered in flickering lights, switches, and buttons. 

Then a deep purring hum rumbled out from within the walls.

Or maybe the edges just couldn’t be seen in contrast to the bright lights swarming towards its center. Metallic clicks and scuttling could be heard from all sides as thousands upon thousands of spider-bots streamed down the rock face to the glowing structure in the middle. The spider-bots all looked exactly alike: about the size of a small dog, they were made of dark, shiny chrome with rows of tiny white lights that ran down each of their eight legs, and had eight red and blue sensors like eyes. 

In the center was a gigantic spider web, and it looked like it was made out of pure light. It stretched 100 meters across in every direction and was slowly growing as more and more waves of spider-bots spun their contribution. Every thick strand seemed to pulse with energy and white light, while thin ribbons of code and language streaked through them. This was the World Wide Web...or it was going to be.

232,4,7,,1,7.7,7.8,Circus School,"Leah was a grown up, but she didn’t always feel like one. Maybe it was because she went to Magda The Magnificent’s Spectacular Circus School and lived in a bright blue house full of other circus students. Or maybe it was because she couldn’t always think straight unless she was standing on her head.

The morning routine in the circus house was always a bit crazy, but Leah loved it all. Breakfast usually began by trying to grab a plate from the tall stack of dishes that The Unbelievable Bogdan had balancing on the tip of his nose. (This was even more difficult on the days when Bogdan was practicing riding his unicycle at the same time.) Then Leon the fire-breather would lend his fiery breath to help cook the eggs or boil the water for tea. (The walls had burn marks here and there from the mornings when Leon was still a bit sleepy.) When Leah left for school, Maria was always there hanging upside down from the doorframe to hand everyone their lunches. (Maria’s long blond pigtails always tickled Leah’s nose and made her laugh.)

But walking into circus school was always the best of all. Everyday was like walking into a gigantic colourful circus tent! Leah never knew what she would see or hear that day (or taste or touch or smell for that matter). Some days she went to her locker to find Felix the Flexible all folded up inside it ready to yell ""Tada!”. One time The Amazing Amanda perfected her magic act by disappearing all of Leah’s homework. The halls were always packed with jugglers juggling jugs and people doing flips. In Magda The Magnificent’s Spectacular Circus School, no two acts were the same and that’s what made it wonderful.

In 1721 (when Benjamin Franklin was just 15), Benjamin’s older brother, James, started his very own newspaper. Benjamin really wanted to write letters and articles for the newspaper, but James would not let him (ugh, big brothers!). So, Benjamin made up the character of Silence Dogood: a smart, and good-hearted middle-aged woman whose husband had died. As Mrs. Dogood, Benjamin wrote funny letters about many issues popular at the time. Then he would leave them under the door of James’ office in secret. James enjoyed the letters and published many of them in the newspaper, not knowing they were really written by his own little brother! Readers of the newspaper also loved Silence Dogood’s letters. Some men even wrote to Silence asking her to marry them! Eventually James found out that Silence Dogood had actually been Benjamin all along. James was so angry that Benjamin ran away to live in the next state over!

237,3,8,,3,8.9,8.7,The Trung Sisters,"Trung Trac and Trung Nhi were two sisters who lived in Vietnam from AD 12- AD 43. They grew up in a small rural village in what would now be Northern Vietnam. They lived in an area called Giao Chi, which was ruled by China (and the Han Dynasty) at that time. The sisters were well-trained in martial arts from a young age because of their father’s position in government. 

As time went on, the relationship between the Vietnamese people and their Chinese rulers got worse. The Vietnamese felt that their people and culture were being attacked and cruelly mistreated. The Chinese were also trying to expand farther into Vietnam to control more of the South. Eventually, Trung Trac’s husband, Thi Sach, tried to stand up to the Chinese rulers and rebel. Unfortunately, his plan failed. The Chinese executed him as a warning to others not to try the same thing.

However, the murder of her husband inspired Trung Trac and her younger sister to do just that: they began to plot rebellion against the Chinese. In AD 40, the Trung Sisters were able to fight a small Chinese unit out of their own village. With the confidence and respect they earned from that, they began to build a large army of 80 000 people– mostly made up of other women (including their own mother)! During this time in ancient Vietnam it was very unusual for women to be warriors, and many people thought it was wrong for these women to be fighting. But the Trung Sisters didn’t care, and within a few months their army of women (riding on a herd of elephants!) had taken back 65 cities from the Chinese! They won freedom for the ancient kingdom of Nanyue, and both became its ruling queens! 

They successfully protected Nanyue from Chinese attacks for the next three years, until they were killed in battle in AD 43. Nobody knows exactly how the sisters died. Some records say that they fell at the hand of a powerful Chinese general, Ma Yuan. Another story says that the Trung Sisters were defeated when their male attackers tried fighting naked, and the mostly female army ran away out of embarrassment (but this is almost certainly just a story). Other records say that the sisters vanished into the sky, or threw themselves into a river and became stone statues.

No matter what happened to them in the end, the Trung Sisters are admired for leading the first resistance movement in Vietnam after 247 years of being ruled by China. Many temples have been built to honor the Trung sisters and there is an annual holiday in Vietnam to celebrate their story. Trung Sisters are still proudly remembered in Vietnam for their bravery and sacrifice.

Most homes in the main cities had their very own water wells, and very advanced systems of clay pipes for the times. The toilets worked by drawing water into jars through the pipes, and then emptying the jars through the toilet holes and into waste pits. The solid waste would later be removed and used for fertilizer.

241,8,8,,3,8.9,10.3,A Nose for Clues,"Now that Clara had narrowed down her list of suspects to three people, she was sure that she’d be able to figure out who had stolen the nose from the famous Nosy General statue. As soon as the museum staff realized what had happened, they sealed off the scene of the crime with her entire class inside it. That’s how Clara knew that the guilty person– and the nose– must still be right there in the room with them. The statue's  stone nose might be missing, but Clara was determined to sniff out the thief!

Clara’s first suspect was Drew Doodleson, but Clara wasn’t certain that Drew could have taken the nose even if he had wanted to. He was so allergic to the polish they used on all the statues in the museum that his nose had been running all day! Anyway, he was still on Clara’s suspect list because besides his allergies, he had another nose problem on his hands: Drew could draw almost anything, but he always said that noses were the hardest. Lately he had been complaining that none of his family members would sit still long enough for him to get the noses right in their portraits.

Suspect number two was none other than the dreaded Ms. Snootle! Ms. Snootle was their school’s vice-principal (and happened to be Clara’s least favourite grown-up in the world), but that was NOT why she was a suspect. When the class had first entered this room on the museum tour to see the statue, Ms. Snootle had been deeply offended that they could see up the Nosy General's nostrils. Clara and the other kids had tried to explain to her that here in the museum, nostrils were ""art”, but Snootle wouldn’t listen. Instead, Ms. Snootle simply turned her big grey bushy head away from the statue to shield her eyes, and began yelling at the tour guide about ""the importance of modesty in this day and age!” 

The final suspect was Annie ""The Android” Anderson. Annie loved robotics and was always tinkering with some gizmo or gadget. Lately she had been bragging about the life-size robot she was building that was going to help her get double servings of dessert from the cafeteria at lunchtimes. Apparently, the only problem with it was that she hadn’t been able to make the robot’s face look exactly human yet, since all it had were bottle caps for eyes, a tube of lipstick for a nose, and an old pencil case as a mouth. And Annie had told Clara just that morning about how her mom was starting to wonder where her favourite lipstick had gotten to.

As Clara weighed the clues and motives in her head, a member of the museum staff asked everyone to check inside their bags and pockets for the nose. As everybody stuck their heads inside their backpacks and coats, Clara heard a muffled sneeze, and that’s when she knew that she’d caught the culprit!

242,3,8,,1,8.9,10.9,Caligula and Incitatus,"Between 37 AD and 41 AD, ancient Rome had an emperor named Caligula, and Caligula had a pet horse. Caligula was not the world’s most popular leader, so a lot of people made up stories about him to make him look bad, or silly, or crazy. Since Caligula lived such a long time ago, it’s hard for historians to know exactly which of these stories are true, and which ones were made up or exaggerated. But we do know that of all the horses Caligula had (which was a lot!), he had a favourite: Incitatus. In Latin, ""incitatus” means ""swift” or ""fast”, and Caligula thought Incitatus was the coolest, fastest, most beautiful horse in all the land!

But some stories say that Caligula’s love for Incitatus went even farther than that! Some stories say that Caligula gave Incitatus a stable made of marble and a feeding trough made of ivory! They say that Caligula clothed his horse in the expensive and rare purple blankets that were meant only for royalty, and that he ordered REAL GOLD to be mixed in with Incitatus’ oats! Some records even say that Caligula had a special collar made for Incitatus that was covered in shiny precious stones.

But the craziest story of all is that Caligula was planning on putting Incitatus in government! According to the legend, Caligula wanted to make Incitatus a ""consul” which was a very important and high-ranking elected position in the Roman government, sort of like a senator. (I guess if the horse disagreed with any laws being passed, he could just shout out ""Neigh”!) Caligula even ordered that a large house would be built and filled with servants so that Incitatus could greet and entertain visiting politicians and royalty from other lands! Some people say that Caligula wanted to make Incitatus a consul as an insult to the other senators (""your job is so easy my horse could do it!”). Other people think that Caligula was just a crazy guy with a thing for horses. But, whether Caligula was serious or just horsin’ around, it is clear that Incitatus was a horse for the ages!

""Me too?” asked Angela. ""Minty gum is my absolute favourite!"" Mindy passed the pack to Angela.

""Me too?” asked Steven. ""My breath is really bad! I had tuna and onions for lunch. Yuck!"" Angela passed the pack to Steven.

""Me too?” asked Jenna. ""If I don't chew gum, I'll bite my nails! My mom hates it when I bite my nails."" Steven passed the pack to Jenna.

Finally, Jenna passed the pack back to John. John reached in to get a piece of gum. But the pack was empty! John's friends felt really bad. They all took the chewed up gum out of their mouths. 

""Sorry John,"" Mindy said. ""Do you want some of ours? There's plenty to share!""

	Blah, blah, blah. 
	Then she saw a strange box on a shelf. It was so colorful! She walked over to it. 
	On the front was a smiling polar bear. Above the polar bear it said ""Win a free trip to the Arctic!” Zeynep saw herself in a big winter coat. She saw herself building an igloo. She saw herself riding a polar bear in the snow. 
	She grabbed the box. She was going to win that free trip no matter what!

Todd floated by with an evil grin. ""Not touching you, can’t get mad!” he chanted.

""Hey dork!"" Gina snapped at him. ""You know why they call it ‘space’? ‘Cause you should give me some!” 

She pushed him. Todd floated slowly away towards the other end of the ship. He flailed his arms around, trying to grab onto something.

Then Rashid felt a small bump on her belly. His parents had always said she didn’t like belly rubs. But Floof didn’t seem to mind. He felt the bump again. It was a metal button! 

""What is that?!” he said to the empty room.

After a moment, he pushed the button. At once Floof jumped up! Her body froze. Her eyes opened wide. But now her eyes were flat and red with rows of tiny numbers running across them! Her mouth clicked open. Rashid jumped back.

""Activated,” said a robotic voice coming from Floof. ""Ready to report.”

Then she heard a flapping sound above her head. She looked up. A big black crow had landed in a tree. The crow looked down its dark, shiny beak at her. Nelly smiled back up at the crow. Then, she went on her way.

She hummed as she walked. Suddenly the crow flew over her head again. It landed in a tree just ahead of her. It watched her walk. She looked at it again, but didn’t stop. Its sparkling black eyes met hers. She felt a cold shiver run down her neck. She passed the crow and started walking faster. Then she heard the flapping sound again. 

Nelly saw the crow land in a tree right in front of her.  She wasn’t humming anymore. She started to run. The sky was almost black. The flapping sound was closer now. She didn’t look back but she knew: the crow was right behind her.

Everyday, the goldfish gazed out that window. It saw the young boy and his friends on their bikes. They all hollered and laughed as they raced down the street. 

One day the fish had an idea. “I want to ride a bike, just like you!” the fish told the young boy. The boy loved the fish, so he agreed. He found a toy bike with one of his dolls. The goldfish jumped from its bowl and onto the bike. But riding the bike was difficult. The goldfish’s fins couldn’t hold the handle bars. Its tail couldn’t push the pedals. And pretty soon, it was even hard for the goldfish to breathe!

The boy put the goldfish back in its bowl. It cried and blubbered and looked very upset.

“I can’t even ride a bike!” the goldfish whimpered. “What good am I, anyway?”

The boy smiled. “You are as good as exactly one goldfish!” he cried. “And that is an excellent thing to be! You can swim all day long and breathe underwater! I don't know many bike-riders who can do that!”

Then he realized: everything needs water to grow! So Dembe ran back through the woods to a stream. He collected some water in a wide green leaf.  When he got back, he sprinkled the water onto the place where the seeds were buried. And then he waited. And he waited. But nothing happened!

“Oh well,” Dembe said to the forest. “Maybe those seeds aren’t really magic after all.”

So Dembe went home with a heavy heart. The next day, Dembe came back to his hidden place in the woods. He thought maybe he would dig up the seeds again. Maybe they made a good snack, at least. But when he got to the place where the seeds were buried, he couldn’t believe what he saw!

Sitting there, covered in dirt was a little girl! She was wrapped in brightly colored silks. 

Her head rested on her knees and her eyes were closed. She seemed to be sleeping.

Hakim saw the lights of his town growing smaller below them. He saw the moonlight reflecting off streams. They looked like thin silver threads. Usually, he was afraid of heights. But right now, Hakim didn’t feel afraid. He wondered if he was dreaming.

He tried pinching his leg. It hurt. He could also feel the cold wind beating against his face. Maybe he wasn’t dreaming after all. But he was riding on the back of a flying horse! How could that be possible? He looked down at the horse’s mane. The hairs were thick and coppery.

“Um, excuse me!” Yazelda called from behind him. “Sorry, it’s just that I can hear all your thoughts. Remember? You're not dreaming. Also, that thing you’re riding isn’t a horse. It’s a pegasus. Try to keep up, will ya?”

She ducked behind a shelf of olives, making sure the old man was still in view. She spotted him a few lanes down, frowning at a carton of milk. Sirvat pulled out her wand and tucked it into her sleeve. Then, very slowly, she pointed it right at the back of his head! She whispered a spell under her breath. And she waited.

It worked right away! Long grey tufts of hair sprouted out of the old man’s ears! The hair kept growing and growing! It spilled down his neck and shoulders. He didn’t even seem to notice! But other people certainly did. Mothers started to move their children away from him. People pointed and sniggered behind their hands. Finally, the hair reached all the way down to his knobbly knees. At last, he noticed. Following the long strands of hair back up to his ears, the old man gave a loud yelp! Then he jumped up and ran out of the store.

“So there!"" she whispered. ""That’s what you get for messing with Sirvat the Witch.""

309,8,3,,1,3.9,2.9,Lying Liger,"Anton and Leon walked towards the Big Cats display. It was a hot and crowded day at the zoo. Anton was wearing a yellow t-shirt with a large fuzzy bumble bee on it. He had just bought it in the zoo's gift shop. ""Bees are the unsung heroes of the animal world, you know!” he had said to anyone who would listen. Leon was looking at the map to find the Bat Caves. He loved how cool and dark it was in there. It made him feel like he was deep deep underground.

But first they would go see the Big Cats. Lions, tigers, cheetahs– the zoo had them all! But when they got close, they saw that something was wrong. A sheet was draped over the Lion Display. It had a sign over it that read: LIONEL THE LION HAS GONE MISSING. DISPLAY CLOSED UNTIL HE IS FOUND. 

Anton read the sign over Leon’s shoulder. ""How do you just lose a whole lion?” he asked. ""I sure hope it isn’t wandering around looking for a snack. We’re some of the slowest animals in here!”

""No way,” Leon replied. ""They wouldn't open the zoo with a lion running around! Let’s just go check out the tigers.”

They joined the crowd around the tiger display. There was a male, two females, and a little cub. All the tigers were asleep on a rock in the sun. Anton stepped closer and pushed his nose against the glass window. There was something strange about the male tiger. It looked like the top of its head had been shaved. And something was off about its stripes, too. Anton looked closer. Was one of the stripes...dripping? Yes, it was! Because the stripes were actually drawn with paint!

""Anton,” Leon said quietly. ""I think I’ve found Lionel the Lion.”

	Clap clap, on! 
	Clap clap, off! 
	Asher could sit there and do it all day. It was like magic! 
	Sometimes he would try different sounds. Not all the sounds worked. 
	He banged the pots. Bang bang, on! 
	He slapped his bare belly. Slap slap, nothing. 
	He knocked on the walls. Knock knock, off!

	He snorted like a pig. Snort snort, nothing. 
	Some sounds worked better than others. But the only sound that always worked was clapping.

The silky red one was Tamara. She didn’t know where the names came from. But as she met each flower, their name just popped into her head. She liked to pick a bunch so that they would all have friends. She thought the flowers talked to each other sometimes but she had never heard them. 

When she got home she would put all the flowers in a glass jar. Then she would give the jar to her mother. Then her mother would put the jar on the kitchen table in the sun. Klara wanted to put every color of the rainbow in that jar. So she had a lot of flowers to pick. 

Klara walked farther up the hill. The grass swayed gently against her ankles. When she got to the top she looked across the shining river. A small wooden hut stood there. Klara had never seen it before. She could smell the wood smoke coming from the chimney. Had it always been there? She didn’t think so. She asked the flowers. They didn’t say anything but Klara felt like they agreed with her.

313,12,3,,3,3.8,2.1,The Mountain,"There once was a mountain as tall as could be. Some people say it had been there since the beginning of time. Its tip dragged through the bottoms of clouds. The mountain saw everything that the sun could touch. It knew the great forest to the north. It knew the wild jungle to the east. It knew the wide plains to the west. It knew the shining sea to the south. It stood there proudly for years and years and years. 

But age wore the mountain down. In time the tall mountain was no more than a hill. Grass settled on its rounded top. A little town grew up on its side. The hill saw everything for miles around. It knew the animals that walked the land. It knew the birds that flew in the sky. It knew the people who worked and danced. It knew the mood of every season. It stood there proudly for years and years and years. 

But age wore the hill down. In time the round hill was no more than a boulder. Scratches marked its hard faces. It sat on the edge of that little town. But the little town had grown into a big town. The boulder saw everything that happened in town. It knew the lights of the pub and the shops. It knew the carts that rolled through the streets. It knew the children that played in the alleys. It knew the cats that walked along the fences. It stood there proudly for years and years and years.

But age wore the boulder down. In time the large boulder was no more than a rock. The rock was no bigger than a basketball. It sat below a great leafy tree in a park in the middle of town. But the big town had grown into a big city. The rock saw everything about the tree. It knew the shape of each different leaf. It knew the birds in every nest. It knew each nook of the tree’s bumpy bark. It knew the twists of the tree’s many roots. It sat there proudly for years and years and years.

But age wore the rock down. In time the small rock was no more than a pebble. It was very smooth and very small. It had been kicked and rolled all through the city. Until one day it landed on the edge of a beach. The pebble looked out at the shining ocean. It remembered when it had reached higher than the clouds. It remembered every season it had seen. It remembered every person and every animal it had known. It remembered the land before this city. The pebble was proud of the things that it knew. 

Then a little boy walked by and picked it up. He held the pebble in his warm hand. Then laughing and pointing, he threw it into the water.

314,5,3,,3,3.6,2.6,Queen Dreck,"Once upon a time there was a very evil queen. Her name was Queen Dreck. Queen Dreck didn’t care about her subjects one bit. She cared about them even less than she cared about the little children in the orphanage (which was not very much at all). She forced servants to lie down in mud puddles to keep her shoes clean. She bragged to the poor about the feasts she ate. She often kicked puppies out of her way! She was greedy. She was mean. Nobody in the whole kingdom liked her. But there was nothing they could do!

Queen Dreck had the magic crown. Whoever had the magic crown got to rule the kingdom. Nobody knew how she got it. Some people think that she stole it from the last Queen’s daughter. Others think that she stole the daughter’s whole head! However she got it, she wasn’t ever going to give it up. Many people had tried to take it from her. Everybody had failed.

Queen Dreck was as sneaky as she was evil. She was good at keeping the magic crown safe. She walked everywhere with strong armed guards. The castle was protected by a moat of flame. When she slept, she held the crown to her chest. She always slept lightly, ready to attack any thieves. That was bad news for thieves, because Queen Dreck was a master of karate.

Queen Dreck was sneaky, but Wigaldo the Wizard was smarter. Wigaldo lived in the castle too. The Queen used him to make poisons for her enemies. But Wigaldo was done with all that now. He only had one last poison to make. And it was for Queen Dreck! Wigaldo crafted a poison that would put the queen in a deep deep sleep. Then he could snatch the crown! 

He made the poison and mixed it into a pot of tea. Just as he was about to leave with it, he had an idea. With one small fix, his plan was ready. He took the tea to Queen Dreck’s bedroom.

“Your Majesty, Queen Dreck, I have your bedtime tea,” he said.

“I see,” said Queen Dreck, raising her eyebrows. “But why have you made it for me, Wigaldo? I usually make the blind maid do it. I like to see her spill the hot tea on herself as she tries to climb the stairs.”

“I was in the kitchen when it was ready, Your Majesty,” Wigaldo said, thinking quickly. “It was my honor to bring it here to you.”

“I see,” Queen Dreck said again. “This isn’t a trick, is it, Wigaldo? I hate tricks. Unless they’re mine. I think you should drink the tea first. Just to make sure there is nothing wrong with it. You wouldn’t want anything bad to happen to your Queen. Would you?”

“Of course not, Queen Dreck,” Wigaldo said. He poured himself a cup of tea. He took a deep breath. And he drank. 

But what Queen Dreck didn’t know, was that none of the tea was reaching Wigaldo’s throat! Clever Wigaldo had tied a small sack to a tooth. It was now sitting empty inside of his cheek. As he poured the tea into his mouth, it only filled up the sack!

Wigaldo put down the empty cup and licked his lips. “Are you ready for your tea now, my Queen?” he said.

Queen Dreck frowned. “Yes, Wigaldo,” she said. “I would have liked to see something bad happen to you. But I will have my tea instead.”

So Wigaldo poured a nice full cup of tea for the queen. She drank it down in one big gulp! A moment later, she was fast asleep. Wigaldo snatched the magic crown from her head. Queen Dreck didn’t stir. Wigaldo ran from the room and into the streets. He waved the crown high above his own bald head as he ran.

“We are free! We are free!” he cried with joy to the cheering crowd. And they were.

315,8,3,,3,3.6,2.4,Library Spies,"Ravi was in the school library. He walked slowly down the narrow path between two tall shelves. He ran his finger along the dusty spines of books. He was looking for a mystery novel he hadn’t read yet. Ravi liked the detective stories best. Finally he spotted one he didn’t know. The spine was fat and blue. It’s title read: THE MISSING MAMMOTH MYSTERY. Ravi pulled it out from the shelf. But through the gap between the books, he saw something strange! A wide blue eye watching him from the next row over! The eye blinked once, and disappeared. Whoever had been watching him was on the run!

Ravi ran to the end of his row. He made a sharp right turn. He heard carpet muffled footsteps fading away. But by the time he turned to look, it was too late. Ravi saw the end of a red ponytail whip around the far corner. He knew that by the time he got there, they’d be gone. At least now he knew that whoever it was had blue eyes, and long red hair. He took out his notebook and wrote that down.

Then Ravi walked back to the mystery section. He had dropped his new book in the heat of the chase. But who would want to spy on him? And why would they be so afraid of being found out? Ravi had no idea. It was all very strange. 

Ravi returned to the row he had been standing in before. He found his poor book lying there on the floor. He picked it up and walked over to a row of plump armchairs. Then he sat down to read. He opened it up to the very first page. But then he heard something behind him. It was somebody breathing! Somebody was standing right behind him! 

But Ravi didn’t move. He played it cool. Slowly, he pulled a small mirror out of his pocket. He always kept one in there for moments like these. He held the mirror against the book’s inside pages. Then he raised the book up in front of him like he was reading. Finally he could see behind him in the reflection. It was one of those spinning metal bookshelves. It was full of brightly colored books of all kinds. He couldn’t see anyone there at all! But then he saw something right at the bottom of the shelf. A pair of purple sneakers!

Ravi jumped up out of his chair! He wanted to catch this spy in the act! 

“Gotcha!” he cried, twisting in the air. But he was only met with a quiet squeaking. The metal bookshelf was spinning around and around. The purple sneakers were gone.

Now Ravi was really curious. He had to know who this spy was. He had to find out who had sent them. So Ravi went into full detective mode. From the direction the shelf was spinning, he guessed which way the spy had gone. He turned up his shirt collar to hide his face. He walked on his tip-toes for ultra quiet sneaking. He hid behind book displays. He hid behind teachers. Finally he reached the other side of the library.

And there behind a door he saw them! The purple sneakers! Ravi ran over and pulled the door open. A girl in a trenchcoat was standing there. She had purple sneakers and red hair tied in a ponytail. Ravi knew her eyes were blue, but he couldn’t see them behind her dark sunglasses. 

“Oh all right!” she yelled at him. “What do you want? Why are you spying on me?” The nearby librarian shushed her.

Ravi couldn’t believe it. Him spying on her? No way! “What do you mean?” Ravi yelled back. “I wasn’t spying on you! You were spying on me!” The librarian shushed them again.

“But you just snuck over here like a sneaky spy!” She whispered this time. 

“That’s because I thought you were sneaking up on me!” he whispered back.

“Oh. Pretty good sneaking. I’m Mabel.” she said. She stuck her hand out at Ravi.

“You’re pretty good too,” he said. He shook her hand. “I’m Ravi.”

“Hey,” Mabel said. “Have you ever thought about being in a detective duo?”

“Only all the time!” Ravi replied. “Let’s do it!”

Ravi and Mabel high-fived. It made a loud and satisfying SMACK! They both grinned as the librarian kicked them out of the library.

316,10,3,,3,3.5,2.3,Captain Critter,"“Please just get it out of here,” Wyatt’s dad called from the bathroom. “You know the rules. Nothing with more than four legs in the apartment.”

“Fine,” Wyatt huffed. “But I don’t get why it’s always my job. You trapped the thing! How come I have to take it out?”

“It’s about being a team player, hon,” came his dad’s reply. Wyatt could hear him washing his hands again. “Molly found it in the sink. And she, uh, raised the alarm.” Wyatt could still hear her sobbing in the next room. “I chased it around and trapped it. It almost took some of me with it, too. Now you just have to bring it downstairs and set it free. Everyone does their part.”

“Ugh, fine. Here I go!” Wyatt called. “But if I’m not back in five minutes, call the fire department. Tell them it ate me alive! On your orders!”

Wyatt kneeled down. He lowered his face to the level of the glass. Trapped inside was a big, disgusting centipede. It was crawling all over. Its creepy little legs were wiggling like crazy. 

“Gross,” said Wyatt. Then he took a deep breath.

Wyatt slid a take-out menu under the glass. He was careful not to leave room for the bug to crawl out. Then he picked up the glass– menu, bug, and all. Holding it at arm’s length, he walked out the front door.

Wyatt’s family lived in an apartment building. All the windows had screens on them. And they lived on the 11th floor. That meant that Wyatt had to bring the bug all the way down to the lobby just to let it out. Wyatt reached the elevators.

He had one hand on the menu under the cup. His other hand was planted firmly on top of the cup. He was NOT going to let that thing get out until they were outside. But it left him no hands for the elevator button. He crouched down and pressed it with his elbow.

“You’re just lucky you didn’t end up in a bug-crushing household,” Wyatt told the bug. “My dad doesn’t like to kill things. Even gross-out things like you. I guess I don’t either. But I don’t like being your personal driver much better.”

The elevator dinged and Wyatt got in. Using his elbow again, he pushed the button for “lobby”. He looked into the cup. The centipede was racing around inside. It crawled up the sides and back down again. It ran around and around. 

“Wow, you’re fast!” Wyatt said. “You must be pretty scared, huh? I would be pretty scared if I was you. Some weird looking giant traps me in a tank and runs off with me? Yeah I’d say that’s nightmare fuel for sure.”

Wyatt watched the floor numbers light up as the elevator went down. 9...8...7. He looked into the cup again. He brought it a little closer to his face. The centipede had stopped running. It was standing on the side of the glass. Its long skinny antenna waved slowly back and forth.

Wyatt laughed. “It looks like you’re waving at me!” he said. “Helloooo in there!” Wyatt tilted the glass a little. The centipede didn’t move. “It’s cool that you can crawl up walls,” he said. “I wish I could do that. Then you could see the whole world upside down! With that plus your speed, you’d make a good superhero. We could call you Captain Critter!”

The elevator rumbled down a few more floors. 4...3...2. Wyatt had a strange feeling. He was almost at the lobby. He was almost done with this gross, icky job. But he felt sad. He didn’t want to lose Captain Critter. 

The elevator dinged again. The doors slid open. They had reached the lobby. Wyatt could see the big glass doors to the street. But he didn’t step out. 

No, Wyatt crouched again and pushed the number 11 button with his elbow. The doors slid shut. Wyatt looked at Captain Critter and smiled. His dad was not going to be happy about his new pet.

317,10,3,,3,3.8,2.4,Finals,"It was the last few minutes of the last soccer game of the season. The finals.  Whoever won this game, won it all. And Miranda wanted to win more than anything.

The sky was a clear, cloudless blue. The late afternoon sun was bright and golden. Miranda could see it glinting off the table of trophies. Parents, siblings, and kids from other teams lined one side of the field. Some were sitting in the grass. Some were munching hot dogs. But all eyes were on the game. The score was 1-1, with just 3 minutes to go.

Miranda looked out at her teammates. Every member of the Panthers wore a royal blue jersey. Each one had their number on the back. They were scattered across the field, but they flowed together like water. They ran in almost perfect step. They passed the ball like they were mind-readers. They had practiced and practiced for this. And they were good. Really good. But there was a problem.

For every royal blue jersey, there was an orange jersey to match. The Rockets. They weren't a very good team. But they played rough. That was the problem. The girls on the Rockets had a bad habit. They liked to foul players when the ref wasn’t looking. Their coach never seemed to be looking either. And when they did get called, they were suddenly all smiles and pigtails. But what did grown ups know about what happened on the field, anyway? On the field it was kids vs. kids. The rest was just details. 

And now they had reached the final game. The game they had been working for all season. They had to win. 

Miranda saw the ball come sailing towards her. She ran and met it as it landed. She ran faster, tapping the ball along with her. She was almost at the Panther’s net! But just then a defender popped up in front of her. The girl was like a human wall. Miranda couldn't get past her. She looked around quickly. Her teammate Vanessa was on her left! She passed the ball to Vanessa and Vanessa took the shot! The ball soared towards the net. But the goalie’s hands were too quick! The goalie punched the ball away. It flew off behind the goal post. 

The whistle blew. Corner kick for the Panthers. Miranda checked her watch. Just one minute left in the game. This was going to be their last chance. Kaitlyn went to take the corner. Kaitlyn had a kick so powerful that she had dented a parking sign once! Almost every member of the Panthers crushed in around the net. It was all a jumble of blue and orange. The whistle blew again. Kaitlyn took the kick.

With a powerful THWACK the ball spun high in the air! It arched over the first few players. Miranda watched it like it was happening in slow motion. She saw the ball starting to drop towards her. She saw the goalie drifting towards the left side of the net. She felt a Rockets player tugging on her jersey. She jumped up and headed the ball! The Rockets goalie reached for it, but it was no use. The ball plunged deep into the right side of the net! 

Nobody heard the final whistle over the screams of joy from the team and the crowd. Everyone rushed the field! They had done it! They had won!

The smells of salty popcorn and frying oil were everywhere. Bodies pushed her this way and that until something stopped her in her tracks. She turned and saw a strange man staring wide-eyed at her. He sat in a booth beneath a banner that read: FORTUNES. He had dark eyes and bony, pale face. He drifted towards her. 

When his face was just inches from her own, he whispered, “Your doom is coming, Mara. Very soon.”

Just then Robert’s furious, heaving breaths started turning into guttural grunts. His face turned red and he bent over, grasping his knees. Dry rasping sounds came up from somewhere deep in his throat. He sounded like my cat trying to pass an especially monstrous hairball. 
	Then, suddenly, with one final hack, a golden ring came flying out of his mouth! It soared gracefully across the room, spinning through the air as if in slow motion. Flecks of spit flew off of it in every direction. Finally, it tinkled to the floor right at my feet.

""Hey, you didn’t have to take it so literally, Bob,” I said, picking up the slimy ring. ""But that will do nicely all the same.”

It was as though he could feel his very heart shiver inside his chest. But maybe that was out of fear, rather than cold. It was deathly quiet down here. But he had to reach the bottom.

The children of the town all began to back away from her, but they knew they were trapped down there in the kitchen. Just then Liza had an idea! She had to stop the feast from happening! As fast as she could she started throwing ingredients on the floor. She toppled the bags of flower and stomped on bunches of tomatoes. The other children joined in.

His heart was beating so hard he thought it must be bruising the inside of his chest. He thought he might just puke it up any second all the same. His throat felt like a mangled tube of razor blades, but there was no chance of stopping.

At first she couldn’t see anything inside at all, but eventually her eyes began to adjust. Not that there was anything to see in the darkness. It was just the big empty gym. Same as always. Why had the note told her to come here? What was she supposed to find? 

“Hello?” she called into the vast room. It was probably just some dumb joke. But since she was here already, she might as well check it out.

She stepped through the doorway and walked to the center of the floor. Every footstep squeaked and echoed through the big space. She looked up towards the high ceiling, trying to make out anything in the darkness.

SLAM! The sound boomed through the gym. Jill whipped around. It was only the gym door finally closing behind her. Now the darkness was complete. She reached a hand out in front of her face to see if she could see it. Then she heard something rustle behind her.

“Now we can talk,” said a voice from the blackness. “Now we’re alone.”

""I don’t think that was there this morning,” Hanif said to himself. He thought about picking it up. It wasn’t really his style. He shrugged and kept climbing. 

But halfway up the next staircase, he found a long, blonde wig!

""That <i>definitely</i> wasn’t there this morning,” Hanif said. ""Someone must have really been losing their head!” Pleased with his little joke, he kept on climbing.

But soon he noticed a pattern. On the last step of the next flight, he found a pink jacket. After that he found a pair of sparkly bell-bottoms. And one large rubber boot! Something strange was going on here, and he was going to find out what.

Nicole looked thoughtful. She tilted her head to one side. “I want to go into space,” she said.

“Yeah, one day I’d love to go into space too!” said Nelson.

Nicole walked out of the room. A few moments later, Nelson saw her flash past the doorway. She was sprinting down the hallway towards the living room. Nelson heard the sound of springs as she jumped up onto the couch. With a sickening lurch, he realized what was happening. But it was too late! The next thing Nelson heard was a big crash from the next room. The spaceship had experienced a failure to launch.

Luna had realized a long time ago that scouting from your own tree was for suckers. If the tree is in <i>your</i> yard, everyone knows that <i>you</i> must be the one in it. But nobody expects you to be in your neighbour’s tree. That’s just a fact.

""Well then I guess you’ll just have to stretch those little roots of yours and find some water, won’t you?” the other flower replied. ""Either way, you better stop bugging me about it. I have enough bugs to deal with already.” At that moment, a large bumblebee sat on its face.

So the thirsty flower stretched its little roots, looking for water. It stretched as far as it possibly could. Then it stretched farther than it possibly could! It stretched and it stretched and it stretched. Finally, it felt a small <i>pop</i>, and a breeze on the tip of its root. The flower had stretched its little roots all the way to China!

But there is one thing that you must never do.” She leaned in close, peering over her glasses at him. “You must never use these scissors to cut paper. Do you understand?”

“But that’s just silly!” Taylor cried. “Who ever heard of a pair of scissors that can’t cut paper?”

As though this thought had made it so, a low rumbling slowly arose. The sound was like the earth itself was growling. Then the ground began to shiver and quake. Dakan inhaled deeply. He could smell them coming on the wind. They were almost here. 

And then, suddenly, they were. The army was vast, and wave upon wave of bloodthirsty creature thundered past below. Now the rumbling was nearly deafening. Thousands and thousands of hooves, feet, and scales pounded their way across the scorched plain. That great roar was punctuated by the monstrous cries and gruesome shrieks of the fighters. 

Dakan raised his sword at the ready. He leapt lightly off the ledge and into the fray. The war had begun.

""Nothing!” Andaya said quickly, straightening up. ""I was just looking into the well. Wishing, I guess.” She gave a small, embarrassed smile. ""It’s silly, I know.”

Andaya looked into Seema’s face and was surprised by what she saw. Usually Seema was the very picture of cheerfulness and light, but just now it seemed like a cloud had passed over her. She looked concerned, perhaps even scared. 

""You haven’t been looking long, have you, Miss?” Seema asked. Was there a tremble in her voice?

But then Casey remembered what his mom had said. 

""Don’t do that, Casey. You’ll scare that cat dead!”



The mailman brought letters to the door of their home. 

Casey wanted to bite him, like his most favourite bone.

But then Casey remembered what his dad had said. 

""Don’t do that, Casey. His pants will be shreds!”



Casey heard a bird chirp in the yard. 

He wanted to scare him. It wouldn’t be hard.

But then Casey remembered what his mom had said. 

""Don’t do that, Casey. The bird’s pretty and red.”



Casey heard a mouse scratch at the door. 

He wanted to let him in to play some more.

But then Casey remembered what his dad had said. 

""Don’t do that, Casey. The mouse will eat our bread!”



Mom and Dad came home with smiles on their faces. 

All the things in the house were all in the right places. 

Mom said, ""Guess who’s coming to the beach with us two?” 

Dad said, ""A very good boy, Casey. You!”

""Zach! It’s time for bed!” Mom yells. I pretend I don’t hear her. 

""Zach! It’s time for bed!” Mom yells again. I keep quiet.

Mom’s footsteps come up the stairs. I hide in my closet.

""Come on, sleepyhead, ” Mom says, coming into my room. ""It’s time to go to sleep.”

I stay still. I stay silent. I hold my breath.

The closet door opens.

""Let’s go, silly,” Mom says. ""Time for bed.”

""Awww!”

""It’s your bedtime,” she says.

""I hate bedtime.”

""You have to go to sleep.”

""Sleeping is boring.”

""You’ll be tired if you don’t go to bed.”

""I’m not tired.”

Mom holds out a hand for me. I take it and get up. ""Do I have to go to bed?” I ask.

""Yes,” she says.

""Could I stay up for just a little longer?”

""No,” Mom says.

""I’m not tired!”

""You’re still going to bed.”

""Could you read me a story?”

I give Mom a sad look. Sometimes when I give her a sad look she says yes. ""Please!” I beg.

""Ok,” she says. ""One quick story.”

""Yes!” I shout.

I jump on my bed and slide under the blanket. Mom sits next to me. I hand her my favorite book, and she starts to read.

The story is really good. It’s about a dragon. I love stories about dragons. I’m happy that Mom is reading to me. I am more happy that I don’t have to go to sleep. I hate bedtime. Sleeping is boring. I’m not tired.

The next thing I remember, the sun is shining in my eyes. It’s morning. I must have fallen asleep!

360,10,6,,3,6.4,0.0,Jeremy and the Wishing Stars,"Jeremy lived in a very tall building, in the middle of a very large city. At night, he could see all kinds of twinkling lights through the window of his twenty-third floor apartment. But Jeremy couldn’t see a single star in the sky.

When Jeremy was very young, his mother had taught him to say, <i>“Star-light, star-bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight.”</i> But whenever he gazed up at the night sky, even if he concentrated with with all his might, he couldn’t see a single star.

Jeremy’s mother explained that the lights of the city are so bright that the stars fade into the background, and become very difficult to see. “But then how do kids in the city make wishes?” Jeremy asked. His mother thought about it for a while, and then said, “You just have to be a little more creative.”

After that, Jeremy began finding stars all over the place. But instead of looking up, towards the empty night sky, he gazed down at the city, through his twenty-third floor window. The city, he found, was actually full of stars, after all. You just have to be a little more creative.

Jeremy made wishes on the blinking lights of airplanes, and on the blinking lights on the tops of tall buildings. He made wishes on the headlights of cars on the freeway (although these were more like shooting stars). And he made wishes on the lights of the city streets, on windy nights, when the treetops danced with the lampposts far below his twenty-third floor window.

Jeremy decided that he was actually pretty lucky to live in the city. “The city is so big and the sky is so small,” he thought to himself. For the little patch of sky that he could see between the tall buildings looked no bigger than a postage stamp. Jeremy figured that there were definitely more stars in the city than you could possibly fit into that tiny patch of sky.

Then, one day, Jeremy’s mother announced that his family was going on a camping trip in the country. Jeremy didn’t like the sound of that idea one bit. He had lived in the city his whole life, and had never been to the country. He didn’t want to leave his twenty-third floor apartment, and all of the twinkling stars of the city.

But, no matter how much he whined, and no matter how much he begged, his mother would not listen. “You’ve never been to the country,” she said. “How do you know you’re not going to like it?” But Jeremy was sure that there was nothing in the country that he would like more than the city.

The next day, they packed up the car and drove off to the country. Jeremy sat in the back seat with his arms crossed and sulked the whole way. They passed lots of trees and farms, and more trees and more farms, and the occasional house along the road.

One farm that they passed had a bunch of cows standing in a field. Jeremy’s mom said, “Hey look! Cows! You’ve never seen cows before, have you?” But Jeremy just continued to sulk. “Big deal,” he said. “You can see cows anytime on milk cartons.”

Another farm had horses, and his mom said, “Hey look, Jeremy! Horses! You’ve never seen those before either!” But Jeremy continued to sulk. “So what,” he said. “You can see horses anytime on TV.”

Finally, they arrived at their campsite and unpacked their things. Jeremy tried to set up his tent but it just turned into a big mess. The sheet got all tangled, the poles wouldn’t fit, and Jeremy got frustrated and sulked <i>even more</i>.

Then, they went for a walk in the woods and Jeremy got bitten by every mosquito. The bites left itchy red bumps all over his body, which his mother told him not to scratch. And Jeremy got frustrated and sulked <i>even more</i>.

Then, it started to rain and their clothing got soaked. They ran back to camp and put on dry things. But Jeremy still felt damp and uncomfortable. He was now very frustrated and sulked <i>even more!</i>

For dinner, they just had cooked hot dogs on sticks and baked potatoes wrapped in tin foil. Jeremy’s mom said, “It’s fun to cook on an open fire!” But Jeremy didn’t think that it was fun at all.

He was cold, and he was itchy, and very, <i>very</i> frustrated! Jeremy stood up and yelled at his mom, “I hate the country! I just want to go home!” Then he turned away from the campfire and stomped back toward his tent.

But away from the campfire, it was very dark, and Jeremy couldn’t see where he was going. His foot slipped on a patch of fresh mud and Jeremy fell straight backwards onto the cold, wet ground.

This should have made Jeremy even more frustrated – and it would have – <i>except</i> that at that very moment, when Jeremy opened his eyes, something amazing happened.

For the first time, when Jeremy looked up at the night sky, he could see stars, as far as the eye could see. And not just a few stars either. Hundreds of stars! Thousands of stars! Millions of stars! Zillions of stars! More stars than you could possibly imagine. “All of the lights in all the cities of the world would not be enough to fill a sky so big,” thought Jeremy. “It would take you a hundred lifetimes to wish on all of those stars!”

Then, Jeremy closed his eyes and concentrated with all his might on a very important wish. He looked up at the stars, twinkling above, and said, <i>“Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish, I wish tonight…”</i>

Afterwards, he continued to lie there, gazing up at the sky for several minutes. Finally, his mother called him from the campfire saying, “Jeremy, are you alright?”

“I’m fine,” said Jeremy with a smile on his face. Maybe the country wasn’t so bad after all.

A few days later, Jeremy’s family packed up their bags and drove back to the city.

That night, Jeremy looked out of his twenty-third floor window, as usual. But, instead of looking down at the lights of the city below, he looked up at the patch of night sky above him. A big grin appeared on Jeremy’s face when he saw that his wish had actually come true.

For there, in that small patch of sky, he could see a single star twinkling away. And when Jeremy saw it, he remembered that somewhere, way up high, above the tall buildings around him, there was a giant sky full of twinkling stars. And they were shining brighter than the lights of any city.

362,10,2,,3,2.0,0.0,My Pet Stick,"My name is Michael. Some of my friends are kids. Some of them are not kids. Some of them are not even people.

I have a pet stick. I named him Henry. He is longer than my arm, and as thick as my thumb. He has a green mark on him that looks like the letter H. That’s why I named him Henry. Henry likes to go places with me.

""Henry, where do you want to go today?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go to the playground,” I say.

We go to the playground. Henry goes down the big slide with me. I hold him high in the air as we slide down fast.

""Henry, where do you want to go next?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go play in the sandbox,” I say.

Henry helps me dig in the sandbox. He digs better than a shovel. We dig a big hole around our castle.

""Henry, where do you want to go next?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go play soccer,” I say.

We practice kicking the soccer ball in the goal. I get many goals. Henry tries, but can’t kick the ball very far.

""Henry, where do you want to go next?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go play fetch with Daisy,” I say.

My dog’s name is Daisy. She loves when I throw things in the yard. I yell ""Fetch!” and she brings them back to me.

I wait for Daisy to get ready. I know that she’s ready when she barks.

Daisy barks, ""Woof!” I throw Henry as far as I can.

""Fetch!” I yell.

Daisy runs to Henry and picks him up in her mouth. Daisy runs back to me.

""Good girl,” I say. 

I pet Daisy on her head. Daisy has brown fur and it feels soft in my hands. She likes it when I pet her.

Henry is wet from being in Daisy’s mouth. I wipe him off on my shorts.

""Henry, do you want to keep playing?”

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s do it again.”

I pull my arm back and throw Henry even farther this time. Henry goes so far he lands in the woods. Daisy runs after Henry, but doesn’t come back.

""Daisy!” I yell.

Daisy is still in the woods.

""Daisy!” I yell again.

Daisy still hasn’t come out of the woods.

I run to the woods. I see Daisy. She is looking for Henry, but she can’t find him. I look at the ground. Now I know why Daisy can’t find Henry. There are hundreds of sticks in the woods and they all look the same!

I pick up many sticks and look at each one carefully. None of them is Henry. None of them is longer than my arm, and as thick as my thumb. None of them has a green mark that looks like the letter H. Henry is lost in the woods. 

Daisy brings me many sticks, too, but none of them is Henry. I sit down on a log and start to cry. Daisy comes over to me and licks my fingers. She sometimes does that when I’m sad.

No more riding on the slide with Henry. No more digging in the sand with Henry. No more playing soccer with Henry. No more playing fetch with Henry. I wipe my tears on my shirt sleeve.

""C’mon, Daisy. Let’s go inside.”

I stand up and walk back towards my house. Daisy follows me. 

That’s when I trip on a root. I land in a pile of even more leaves. As I get up, that’s when I see him.

""Henry!”

Henry was hiding under the pile of leaves, and I fell right next to him. He is longer than my arm, and as thick as my thumb. He has a green mark that looks like the letter H. Yes, it’s Henry! Henry is dirty from his trip into the woods. I wipe him off on my shorts.

""C’mon, Henry and Daisy. No more woods for us today.”

Mom calls me to come inside. It’s time for dinner. She won’t let me bring Henry inside the house, so I leave him on the deck.

""Where do you want to go tomorrow?” I ask Henry.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. We’ll just do it all again.”

Henry doesn’t answer. He’s the strong, silent type.

363,10,5,,3,5.6,0.0,Not Identical,"First of all, no, we are not identical. Just because we sort of look alike doesn’t mean that we are identical twins.

Yes, Molly and I were born 12 minutes apart.

Yes, we have the same mom and dad.

Yes, we are both girls.

Yes, we both have blue eyes and curly brown hair.

Yes, we are both the same height.

That’s where it stops though. Everything else about us is totally different.

Molly loves reading. I’d rather rake leaves or clean windows than read a book.

Molly gets As on all of her tests. I’ve never even seen an A. Ever.

Molly loves shopping for clothes. I love shopping for sports equipment.

Molly’s name is easy to spell. My name, Kaitlyn, everyone spells wrong. 

See, we’re totally different. People always think we’re identical twins because at first they think we look the same. Once you look closely at us though, you could tell we’re fraternal twins. People don’t usually know the difference.

Fraternal twins are born one after another, just like identical twins. However, fraternal twins could be two boys, two girls, or even a boy and a girl. They also don’t look the same.

Like us.

Molly has a bigger nose. I have bigger lips. Molly also has a big freckle on her right cheek. I don’t.

Although we sometimes get annoyed when people get us confused, it does have its advantages. Like the time we pulled off the greatest twin switch in history. 

It all started at our new school. At the end of third grade, our dad got good news with his company. They moved him up to a vice-president or something. At first Mom was really happy, but then we found out we’d have to move because his new job was about five hours away.

Mom still pretended that she was excited. Molly and I knew better. She was just pretending because she knew Molly and I hated that we had to move. I was a little upset, but Molly was really mad. Molly said she wasn’t going, that she’d live in the basement of the school. Molly is known for being overly dramatic. 

About a year ago, Molly and I were out raking leaves when Molly poked her finger with a small branch. It was the tiniest cut in the world, but you would have thought she had her finger chopped off the way she was screaming. Dad came running out and carried her inside. Yes, she was actually carried inside. 

She got out of raking leaves for the next hour while she <i>rested</i> her finger. Mom wasn’t home at the time - she wouldn’t have fallen for Molly’s trickery. Dad still does though. He’s a sucker for her dramatics.    

Dad moved into an apartment a couple weeks later, until we could find a house. As a compromise, Mom stayed back with us so we could finish the last two months of the school year. The day that school finished, we moved, too.

It was a boring summer because we didn’t know anyone in Pegoria, our new town. About a week before we moved, Dad bought us a house. It was at the edge of this gigantic national forest, which meant that everywhere you looked all you saw were trees and mountains. We did have a cool lake in our backyard, but except for old Ms. Henderson, who lived by herself about a half mile away with her seven cats, there was no one else to play with anywhere near us. The population of the entire town was only 3,000 people! We were excited to start fourth grade so we could make some friends. 

We had never been in the same class before because our old school always wanted twins separated as much as possible. In Pegoria, that wasn’t an option. There was only one fourth grade class. 

We both had Mrs. Pritchett, a grey haired woman who looked like she had been teaching for fifty years. When Mrs. Pritchett introduced us, she mixed up our names.

Not exactly an unusual thing for us.

Normally, Molly jumps right in and corrects anyone who mixes us up. This time though, she didn’t.

I stared at Molly, expecting her to say something. When she finally did, it took me by complete surprise.

“Could you please both tell us a little something about yourself,” Mrs. Pritchett said. “Who would like to go first?”

Molly quickly raised her hand, and gave me a quick glance. I knew that look. A sly and mischievous smile coated in honey and syrup. A smile she’d used countless times to get her way. I knew it was trouble.

“Hi, my name is Kaitlyn,” Molly said. “I just moved here with my sister Molly. I love sports, helping out with chores around the house, and I have to admit, I don’t really like reading.”

The class snickered at the part about reading.

“Thank you, Kaitlyn,” Mrs. Pritchett said. “Alright, Molly. Tell us something about yourself.”

I looked up, realizing she was talking to me. I looked around. The entire class was looking at me. Molly just stood there, her hands clasped together, staring at me as well with her twisted smile.

I didn’t want to do it, but I didn’t really have a choice. I opened my mouth and said the words I would regret for years to come.

364,10,4,,3,4.2,0.0,Operation MSL,"Mrs. Scudder is my third grade teacher.

I’ve been mostly lucky to stay off of her bad side. I’m not on her good side, because <i>no one</i> is on her good side, but at least I’m not on her bad side.

My name is Scott and I’m just a normal kid. 

I play soccer. I like to ride my bike. Both my sisters are annoying. 

My older sister, Amy, had Mrs. Scudder when she was in third grade. Amy said that she is fair because she’s mean to everyone. Equally.

I don’t believe that. When you’re on her bad side, you know it.

There’s this one girl, Mariah, who accidentally spilled paint on Mrs. Scudder’s desk back in October. 

It was a watery purple paint that my group was using for a project on the solar system. The paint was in one of those red plastic cups. Mariah was carrying it back from the sink when she tripped. 

The paint flew through the air and splattered all over Mrs. Scudder’s teacher stuff. All of her papers and whatever else teachers keep on their desks were covered in purple paint. 

The worst part was that Mrs. Scudder was sitting at her desk at the time. When she looked up she had purple paint all over her face.

If I didn’t know better, I would have laughed.

It was really funny.

It was also super scary. 

Mrs. Scudder's face turned bright red, her lip curled up like an angry momma bear, and I thought she was going to spit fire out of her eyeballs. 

Mariah looked too scared to even cry. 

***

Kids from Mr. Boone’s room down the hall told us later that they heard the yelling through their closed classroom door.

""It sounded like a monster,” Miles said.

""I thought someone was being attacked,” Katie said.

""I thought the world was ending,” Devin said. 

We all (except Mariah) laughed about it later, but not until recess. Not until we were sure Mrs. Scudder was far, far away. 

Mariah is definitely on her bad side.

Mrs. Scudder didn’t scream that loudly again until Derek joined our class.

It was a cold January day when he arrived. January 7 to be exact. 

We later knew it as the birth of Operation MSL.

Mrs. Scudder stood at the front of the classroom. She was behind Derek with her hands gripping his shoulders. She introduced us to Derek as ""our friend from the west coast.” Derek just moved here from California. 

He looked like he was from California. Like one of those surfer kids. 

Floppy blond hair.

Big freckles. 

A summer tan. In January.

I remember exactly what he was wearing. A blue bathing suit and a black tank top. Did I mention it was January? There was snow on the ground and this kid shows up in a bathing suit. 

I instantly liked him. So did all the other kids. 

I’m pretty sure Mrs. Scudder instantly hated him.

All the boys wanted to sit with him at lunch, but only eight kids are allowed at a table. I was one of them.

***



""Dude, what’s up with Mrs. Scudder?” Derek said. ""Does she ever smile?”

""No,” everyone answered at once.

We all laughed.

""No, seriously. Has she <i>ever</i> smiled?”

Heads shook no.

""Actually, there was one time,” I said. ""Mr. Caramel came on the announce-”

""Wait,” Derek interrupted. ""Some dude here is named Mr. Caramel?”

""Yeah. He’s the principal.”

Derek’s face broke into a huge toothy smile. ""The principal here is named after a candy?”

""Ha! I never thought of it like that,” I said.

""Is the librarian named Mrs. Gumballs?” Derek joked.

Everyone laughed again.

""So anyway,” I said, after I was done laughing. ""Mr. Caramel came on the announcements a few weeks ago in the morning. He said we were getting out of school early that day because we were getting a big snowstorm.”

""What do you mean, getting out early?” Derek asked.

""It means that we only have a half day of school,” I said.

""Whoa, that’s cool,” Derek said. ""That doesn’t happen in California.”

""Yeah, and that’s when Mrs. Scudder smiled.”

""She loves getting away from us,” Johnny said.

""Yeah,” Mason added. ""She was probably happy to go home so she could yell at her cat.”

""But that’s it,” Ricky said. ""She never smiled any other time.”

We all nodded in agreement.

Derek rubbed his hands together like a mad scientist.

""Well then, boys,” Derek said, looking at all of us with his giant grin. ""Operation Make-Scudder-Laugh is about to begin.”

We later renamed it Operation MSL so the girls wouldn’t know what we were doing, but they figured it out the next day anyway. 

Lindsay was the one who found out. She’s the smartest kid in class. Nothing gets by her. 

It turns out that it wasn’t a big deal though. The girls were just as excited to be a part of it as we were.

Derek was our official leader, but he let everyone be a part of the operation.

Plans were made. 

Secrets were exchanged.

Operation MSL had begun.

It was what made third grade the best and worst year of my life.

365,10,5,,3,5.6,0.0,Shaking Everest,"<b><i>May 12, 2015</i></b>

<b><i>11:45 AM </i></b>

<b><i>Mt. Everest Base Camp (Nepal)</i></b>

 

The food isn’t horrible, but it definitely isn’t my mom’s cooking. I just finished my lunch, this mushy mixture of rice and lentils called Dal Bhat. It seems like this is on the menu every single day. Now I am sipping a mug of warm Nepali tea. Before arriving in Nepal, I never even liked tea. Here, everyone drinks tea. Even kids.

I may only be 12-years-old, but now I’m just as hooked on this delicious beverage as everyone else in Everest Base Camp. 

My dad and I arrived in base camp one month ago, in mid April. I’d been dreaming about this trip for the past five years. When I was seven-years-old, I saw a television show about a boy named Jordan Romero, who became the youngest person in the world to climb Mt. Everest at only 13.

I told my dad I wanted to do that. Not just to do it. To beat his record. 

Most dads would laugh, but my dad is not like most dads. An experienced mountaineer himself, he was a member of the Seven Summits Club. That means that he has climbed the highest peaks on all seven continents. He became a member a few years before I was born, when he climbed Everest for the first time. Since then, he’d climbed Everest two more times, both on the Chinese side and Nepal side of the mountain.

It was five years of dreaming and preparation, but here I was, right at the bottom of the tallest mountain on the entire planet. Technically, I was too young to even try climbing it. It was very dangerous - people died every year trying to make it to the top. Last year they ended the climbing season early when a block of ice the size of a mansion came roaring down the mountain. The avalanche killed 16 guides, mostly Sherpas, and out of respect almost everyone left the mountain days later. 

Since the climb was so dangerous, you were supposed to be 16-years-old, but Dad knew I was ready. I climbed more peaks than many of the adults trying to go up this year. Dad also worked for the U.S. government and had a lot of connections with the Napalese. Somehow he made it happen. 

Finishing the last drops of my tea, I left the mug with Tensing, who was the expedition cook. He was also the coolest Sherpa on the mountain.

“Tensing, have you seen my dad?” I asked.

“No, dude. No dad here.”

Tensing was a member of the Sherpa tribe, a tribe that lived in the Khumba valley surrounding Everest. Without the help of the Sherpa people, trips to the top of the world would be impossible. Sherpas were a major part of any expedition to Everest, helping with everything from cooking to climbing.

Tensing also liked to call me <i>dude</i> for some reason. I was from Maine, where no one said dude, but Tensing thought every American kid said dude. I think he watched too many old American TV shows.

“Dude, eat. Eat more food,” Tensing said in broken English, his big toothy smile making me grin. “I make big feast today.” 

“No thank you,” I said, rubbing my stomach. “I’m stuffed. I’m going over to see Pemba. Please tell my dad where I am if he comes by.”

“Okee dokee, dude. If hungry later. Come eat.”

“Thanks. See you in a bit.”

I pulled aside the big yellow flap that covered our mess hall tent, and immediately pulled down my sunglasses. Even though it was cold enough to need a coat and hat, the sun was bright, which made you want to take off your hat and coat. It didn’t really make sense, but at 17,598 feet above sea level, a lot of weather things were strange around here. Even at base camp, we were higher up than every mountain in North America except Mount McKinley in Alaska, which I climbed last year. I would have been the youngest to climb it, but Jordan Romero was one month younger than me when he reached its peak!

 Everest Base Camp was so high up that we had to spend 10 days hiking just to get used to the high altitude. If you tried to go up too high too fast you could get really sick.

I saw Pemba sitting down on a rock, a few tents away. Pemba was one of the climbing sherpas with our expedition. He was also really good at soccer. 

Everest Base Camp was really just a giant tent city that only existed during its short climbing season each spring. The rest of the year the weather was too unpredictable to attempt a climb. It was full of large expeditions like ours that had big tents to hang out in and even watch movies, and tiny one-person tents for people trying to climb the mountain by themselves.

Pemba had been teaching me a few soccer moves over the past few weeks, but the ground was so rocky here that it wasn’t easy. It was also hard to play soccer for too long because the high altitude made you get tired very quickly.

“Pemba, wanna play soccer?” I yelled.

I felt dizzy for a moment and almost fell down. It felt like the ground was shaking.

Pemba looked up at me and smiled, but then quickly turned his head away toward the sound.

I heard it, too. 

Everyone did. 

It sounded like a cross between a giant tree snapping in half and a bomb exploding.  

Almost instantly, the boom progressed into a low rumble, almost like that of an oncoming train.

I looked at Pemba. His eyes were wide with fear. 

“Avalanche!” he screamed. “Run!”

Now the source of the sound was clear. A massive cloud appeared from the top of the mountain next to Everest, and it was coming straight at me.

368,10,2,,3,2.9,0.0,The Class Pet,"<b>Chapter 1</b>

Hi. My name is Molly. 

I am just a normal kid, like every other kid. But today is not a normal day.

Today I start Grade 2. You might be thinking, why am I so excited to start school? Well, the thing is, Grade 2 is going to be different.

This year I get to be in Mrs. Jenkin’s class. Mrs. Jenkin’s classroom is special because it has a class pet named Snoopy.

He is a guinea pig. He is black and white, and has long hair that covers his eyes. I know this because in Grade 1 I used to walk by Mrs. Jenkin’s classroom just to see Snoopy. 

I was so jealous of the Grade 2 students that got to feed and take care of Snoopy. Mrs. Jenkin’s even let the students take Snoopy home!

I love animals, but my mom and dad will not let me have a pet. I beg and beg, but they still say no. They say a pet is a lot of work, and I am too young to have that kind of responsibility.

But little did they know, I have a plan.

 

<b>Chapter 2</b>

“Molly, you are going to be late for school,” Mom yells from the kitchen.

I am almost ready, but I can’t find my favorite shoes. The sparkly silver sneakers with bright pink laces.

I bend down and look under the bed. There they are! I slip one foot inside, and then the other.

“Molly, the bus is going to be here any minute!”

Mom is getting upset now. I better hurry. The problem is that I just learned how to tie my shoes over the summer.

I take both laces in my hands and think carefully.

“Over, under, pull it tight,” I think in my head. “Make a bow and pull it through to do it right.” 

Got it!

I do the same with the other shoe, and run downstairs.

Jack is sitting at the kitchen table. He is my little brother. He’s not big enough to go to real school yet. He goes to preschool a few days a week. Mom says it will get him ready for big kid school.

“Molly, hurry up and eat some breakfast,” Mom says.

I sit next to my brother, and look down at my plate. Waffles! My favourite.

“Thanks, Mom,” I say.

Mom gives me a smile as she wipes my brother’s face with a napkin.

I eat my breakfast quickly, and run to the door.

Mom is already there with my backpack in her hand. “Have a great first day of Grade 2. I can’t wait to hear all about it.”

She helps me put on my backpack and gives me a kiss on the head.

“Bye!” I yell as I walk down the driveway.

Just as I reach the end the bus comes around the corner. Perfect timing. The bus stops at the end of our driveway. I turn around and give another wave to Mom. I step up the stairs of the bus.

“This is going to be a great year,” I think in my head.

<b>Chapter 3</b>

I find a seat near the front of the class. My friend Amy sits down at the desk next to mine.

I haven’t seen Amy all summer because she went away to soccer camp.

“Hi Molly,” she says.

“Hi Amy, how was camp?” I ask.

 “It was fun. I played soccer every day and got to stay with a different family. They had a pool and everything!” she says.

“That sounds fun,” I say. I try to keep my eyes on Amy as she talks more about camp, but I can’t help but notice Snoopy’s cage.

It is on a small table beside the window near the reading corner.

I wonder to myself who will get to take Snoopy home first? It just has to be me! The sooner I take Snoopy home, the sooner Mom and Dad will see how responsible I am and let me have my very own pet.

“Molly, are you listening?” Amy asks, sounding frustrated.

“Oh sorry,” I say. “Hey do you know if Snoopy is in his cage?” 

Amy just rolls her eyes at me.

Just then Mrs. Jenkins starts to speak in front of the class. “Good morning class, and welcome to Grade 2.”

369,5,4,,3,4.0,0.0,The Reading Fairy,"Lucy and Alex had all kinds of books: 
storybooks, science books, some just for cooks.
Some smelled like dust, and others were new, 
and some had hard covers, but only a few.

Some books had pictures and some were without,
but neither one knew what these were about.
Because Lucy and Alex, back when they were small,
just played with their books, but read not at all.

They used all their books in all kinds of ways.
As sketchpads, as door-stops, and even a maze.
They piled them up and climbed way up high,
for a better view, when they wanted to spy. 
And sometimes, when monsters and ghosts would come near,
they built a strong fort, so they’d sleep without fear.

One day, their mother came into their room. 
She glanced all around and she started to fume.
She said, ""Look at these books all over the floor!” 
""You climb them and use them as stops for the door!”
""You use them for warding off monsters in bed,
but oh, how I wish you would <i>read</i> them instead!”

But Lucy and Alex said impatiently,
""We need them for crossing this moat! Don’t you see?” 
""The carpet is water, this book is a rock,
and only from one to the next can we walk.”

Their mother just sighed and nodded her head,
then spoke to them softly, and here’s what she said:
""The reading fairy will think it’s too bad.
When children don’t read, she gets very sad.”

Lucy and Alex then stopped suddenly,
and asked who this reading fairy might be.
""The reading fairy,” their mother began,
looks after the books in all of the lands.”

""She’s read every story, and knows them by heart, 
the first word, the last word, and each little part.” 
""She treasures her books, and loves nothing more, 
than sharing her gifts with the kids she adores.” 

""But when children don’t read, and their books are for play, 
then she becomes sad and starts fading away.”
That night, in their dreams, the fairy came down,
and whisked them away in her silvery gown. 

She showed them the places where readers can go, 
and magical spells that only <i>they</i> know.
They visited castles with dragons and moats…
They searched for lost treasure with pirates on boats...

They visited space and sat on the moon....
They visited jungles with bears and baboons…
They visited sweet shops with cakes and ice creams…
And places that only existed in dreams…

The fairy explained that these worlds live in books. 
They’re inside the covers, if only you look.
And when they awoke in their beds the next day, 
they wished to go back to those worlds right away. 

So Lucy and Alex did just as she said. 
They ran to their books and they read, and they read.
When their mother woke up, to her shock and delight, 
she saw in their room an unusual sight.

Lucy and Alex were reading away, 
not throwing, not climbing - at least for today.
And the reading fairy was glad in her heart, 
and thought to herself, ""Well, it’s good a start.”

370,10,2,,3,2.5,0.0,The Sandcastle Monster,"My name is Holly. It is a hot summer day. My family is going to the beach.

When we get to the beach we eat lunch. I eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. My little brother, James, eats gross baby food. My mom and dad eat gross adult food. I eat my sandwich fast because I want to go play.

When I am done eating I take out my shovels and buckets. I have three shovels and two buckets. My red bucket is for making towers. My blue bucket is round. My shovels are all different sizes.

It is time to build the sandcastle. The first thing I have to do is make a big pile of sand. At first it is easy to dig. The sand is not heavy. I dig deeper. The sand is getting heavier. Now it is not so easy to dig.

My pile of sand is huge now. It is taller than James. Now it is time to start carving my sandcastle.

I push on the pile of sand with both hands to make it stronger. Then I fill my red bucket with sand, and dump it upside down on the pile. This is how I make the towers. When I slowly take off the bucket, there is a tower. I make three more towers.

I use my smallest shovel to make windows in the towers. I use my medium shovel to make doors in the towers. I use my biggest shovel to make the towers stronger.

Now it is time to dig a moat. A moat is a hole all the way around the castle that you fill with water. At first it is easy to dig. The sand is not heavy. I dig deeper. The sand is getting heavier. Now it is not so easy to dig.

I use all the extra sand I dig up to make a wall around the castle. It is time to fill the moat with water. I walk down to the ocean, and fill my blue bucket with water. James tries to follow me and my dad picks him up.

The bucket is too heavy to carry so I dump some water out. It is hard to walk, but I make it back to the sandcastle. I dump the water in the moat. It barely fills any of the moat. This is going to take a lot of trips to the ocean.

I go back and forth many times. Finally, the water is starting to fill the moat. After many more trips, the moat is finally full! I am so tired that I lay down in the sand and close my eyes.

I hear my mom yelling, but it is too late. The sandcastle is destroyed. It was destroyed by a monster. A monster named James. A two-year-old sandcastle monster.

The towers are ruined. The wall is ruined. The moat is ruined.

I am so mad. I am ready to cry. Then James comes over, gives me a big hug, and says “sorry”.

I cannot be mad at James. I hug him back and tell him it is okay. I still love him, even if he <i>is</i> a sandcastle monster.

371,5,2,,1,2.0,0.0,The Tale of Arno,"There once was a place,
in a far away land.
A wonderful space,
where nothing was bland.

The trees were all tall,
and the leaves were all green.
The lakes were so deep,
and everything was clean.

This place was called Arno,
as you’ll soon come to know.

Away from Arno,
was a boy named Jon.
He dreamed of Arno,
each night as he yawned.

As he would drift,
deep deep into sleep,
he’d picture the trip
to lakes so deep.

He longed for Arno,
a place you’ll soon come to know.

Each day Jon would wake,
as the sun shined in beams.
He would draw and create,
pictures of his dreams.

He drew all the lakes,
all the forest and hills.
The rabbits, the snakes,
and the porcupine’s quills.

He longed for Arno,
a place we promise, you’ll soon come to know.

Jon always went to school,
and sat in his class.
He would follow each rule,
and each test he would pass.

The teacher had them write,
stories in their book.
Jon’s mind would take flight,
with each turn his tale took. 

He wrote of Arno,
a place we still promise, you’ll soon come to know.

That day as Jon walked,
all the way home.
He found himself shocked,
at the sight of a gnome!

A wee person so small,
that Jon could barely see.
A gnome that was not tall,
but sang as loud as three!

The gnome was from Arno,
a place you’ll soon come to know.

""Who are you?”
asked Jon, quite shocked.
""I am Rilo, it’s true!”
The gnome danced as he talked.

""Where do you come from?”
asked Jon, still afraid.
""An island known only to some,”
Rilo said as he played. 

The island of Arno,
a place you’ll very soon come to know.

""Where is Arno found?”
asked Jon, still unsure.
""The end of the long way around,”
Rilo yelled from the floor.

""That’s not a way to a place,”
said Jon quite annoyed.
A smile appeared on Rilo’s face,
as with Jon the gnome toyed.

""Follow me to Arno… 
a place you are now about to know”.

""We’ll be back in a flash,”
said Rilo the wee gnome.
""Unless we should crash,
I’ll bring you back home”.

""Crash what?” asked Jon,
as he chased to catch up.
Rilo skipped along,
singing back, ""The flying teacup.”

""The flying teacup will take us to Arno,
a place you’ll soon come to know.”

Jon ran home very fast.
Would his parents say yes?
A great trip at last,
to the place he’d soon like best.

They opened the door,
and both said ""Hello”.
Down went Jon’s mother,
fainting at first sight of Rilo.

""Wake up- we are going to Arno,
a place we’ll all soon get to know”.

They all climbed aboard
the bright colored cup.
Away they soared,
Rilo, Jon, and his parents and pup.

""This cup has magic powers,”
Rilo said as they started to spin.
Jon’s eyes fell on flowers,
lakes, and Rilo’s sly grin.

""We’ve arrived in Arno, 
the secret to which you’ll soon know!”

Wide-eyed and amazed,
Jon looked every which way.
""It’s not possible,” quite dazed,
he heard his parents say!

""Anything can be true,”
said Rilo quite proud.
""Beauty comes from the things that you do,”
he smiled, calling aloud.

""We’ve arrived in Arno, 
the secret to which, we promise you’ll soon know!”

""What do you mean,
by the things that you do?”
With the beauty he’d seen,
how were these words true?

""You’ll soon wake up!
This is all just a dream.
The tea cup, and Arno,
are not quite what they seem.

You’re about to learn the secret of Arno,
a secret that I hope you’ll forever know”.

The gnome waved a hand,
and came very close.
The grass turned to sand.
Jon thought he’d seen a ghost.

""Arno is the earth,
the spirit of all things.
We must not hurt,
the nature from which life springs!

You’re learning the secret of Arno,
a secret that I hope you’ll forever know!

So when you wake up,
remember my words.
Remember the beauty, the tea cup,
the animals in herds.

Know that whatever you do,
your actions are strong.
That it is certainly true,
So don’t treat your earth wrong.”

""Take the knowledge of Arno and use it on Earth.
It's your only home ever. Nothing could have more worth!""

372,10,3,,1,3.7,0.0,The Man Who Fed the Birds,"There once was a man with little old feet,
Who came every day to the park down the street.

He sat on the bench with his small bag of seed,
And all of the little birds there he would feed.

Before very long, a great many came,
And when each arrived, he called them by name.

The birds greeted him, as each came along,
And each sang to him, their own little song.

The sparrows sang higher, the ravens sang low,
And the starlings all chirped as they swooped to and fro.

The robins all sang their sweet melody,
And the chickadees sang, ""chick-a-dee-dee-dee-dee.”

The old pigeons cooed with a sad kind of note,
And the mourning dove sang with a frog in her throat.

The geese honked away, in Canadian style,
And the little ducks quacked as they marched single file.  

The thrushes were merry, the cardinals proud,
And everyone thought that the seagulls were loud!

While they sang their tunes, the man waved his hand,
Conducting them like his own little band.

They ate from his palm and chirped their great thanks,
Then flew to their flock to rejoin the ranks.

They swooped and they soared in lovely formations,
On wings that had flown them to many far nations.

Watching them play on the wind like a kite,
My little mind raced with joy and delight.

They seemed so at ease and, though it’s absurd,
I thought to myself, ""...wish I was a bird.”

The days became cool and the trees became bare, 
And one day that man in the park wasn’t there.

I ran to his bench and looked all around,
But the little old man was not to be found.

I went to my to mother with tearful lament,
And asked if she knew where the little man went.

She held my small hand and smiled a sad smile,
And said, ""it was nice that he stayed for a while.”

""But like his dear friends - the blue jay and bittern, 
He went with the birds and flew south for the winter.”

That cake was the most beautiful thing he had ever laid his eyes on. His mouth was watering just looking at it. He knew this was the cake to get for Roger. On the way home, Wally was tempted many times to eat Roger the Rooster’s cake. But he didn’t. He knew it was a gift for his friend.

Later that day, the party began.

When Wally showed up with the cake to the party, everyone stared at it with big smiles. Wally left the cake in the kitchen where Roger would not see it. Wally was the only one who knew where the cake was.

As the party started and games were played, Wally became very hungry. His hunger made him think of how good the cake had looked in the bakery. Wally left the games and snuck into the kitchen.

The cake sat there looking simply amazing. Suddenly, he could not stop himself any more! Wally dove face first into the cake.

Before he knew it, the cake was gone, and icing was all over his face. As he turned around, there was Roger the Rooster with tears rolling down his eyes. Wally knew he had made Roger very sad. Roger left the kitchen, went to his room, and locked the door.

Wally felt bad. He knew he had to find something to make this up to Roger. He went to Paddy the Panda’s Pastry Shop to find an even better cake.  He spent all the money he had on a cake that was 10 times as big as the first! 

It had sparklers all around the bottom, fireworks poking out the top, gummy bears stuck to every inch, chocolate icing on the outside, ice cream on the inside, AND a message written in gumballs that said “Happy Birthday Roger!”.

Wally carefully ran back to the party with the cake and put it on the table. He got the others to light it and then knocked on Roger’s door. Roger opened his door and saw the best cake he had ever seen in his life! It was taller than the fridge! It was wider than the couch! Wally and their friends sang “Happy Birthday” to Roger and it put a big smile back on his face.

Wally told Roger that he was sorry for eating the first cake. They hugged. 

Wally learned that he should treat others how he would like to be treated. Wally and Roger have been best friends ever since. They always put each others feelings first, <i>even</i> when there’s cake around.

377,11,5,,1,5.8,0.0,Mind Ship,"Neil stepped into the central hub of the spaceship. It didn’t look the way that he had imagined it from all the movies and his comics. He had expected it to be filled with thousands of tiny flashing lights, and shining multicolored buttons. He had thought there would be levers and switches and computer screens showing complicated radar readings. But there was none of that. 

Instead the hub was very small, and very dark. The walls were all curved and the ceiling was low. It made him feel like he was inside a bird’s egg. Strangest of all, there were no windows in this room. How was he supposed to see out, let alone steer the ship? 

He took another step into the room, though it was difficult to see. His footsteps were muffled by thick carpeting that covered every inch of the floor, walls, and ceiling. In fact, as he moved he made no sound at all. Now that Neil noticed it, the room was so silent that it was almost like sound was being sucked out of it completely. That thought sent a cold shiver up the back of his neck.

His eyes finally adjusted enough to the dark to notice a chair stationed in front of him. He walked around to the front and sat down. A strange tingling sensation ran up his legs and down his arms. He blinked, and for the split second his eyes were closed he saw something– a flash of light! He closed his eyes again. 

He was looking out from the front end of the ship. He could see the infinite expanse of blackness and stars beyond. But he wasn’t looking out a window of the ship at this view. He <i>was</i> the ship. 

As that surreal realization settled into place, a small voice chimed inside his head.

""Sweet dreams, Honeybear,” he said. ""Want me to come tuck you in?”

<i>Chk</i>. She heard something but didn’t open her eyes. <i>Chk chk</i>. Was that the sound of the tablet turning on? <i>Chk chk. Chk chk</i>. She let out a small sigh and turned over, finally opening her eyes. But when she looked at the tablet, it was just how she’d left it. It lay on the table, dark and still. 

""Shhhh...” she mumbled quietly, already letting her eyes close again. 

This time she was just about to drift off to sleep when something caught her attention. Her eyes were still closed, but a bright light was suddenly flooding through them. She focused on the glaring red of the insides of her eyelids for a moment. She tried to pull herself awake again. Then she opened her eyes once more. 

This time, something was different.

The tablet still lay there on her bedside table like before. But it wasn’t dark any longer. The screen had turned on, shining a blazing white light up at the ceiling. Now she had to actually get up. 

She pushed herself up on her elbows and grabbed the tablet. The light was hard on her sleepy eyes. She squinted down at it, frowning, and pushed the off switch again. 

Nothing happened. 

She pushed it a few more times, quickly becoming frustrated. 

""What is wrong with you? Stupid thing,” she growled at it. She reached for its charger. But just as her hand closed around the cord to yank it out, she stopped.

A text bubble had appeared on the bright white screen. 

""<i>I wouldn’t do that, Jacinda.</i>” it read. 

Jacinda stared down at it, her mouth hanging open. Another message appeared.

""<i>Take your hand off my charger. You don’t want to see what happens if you don’t.</i>”

Jacinda couldn’t move. She didn’t take her hand off the cord, but she didn’t pull it free either. She suddenly noticed her own heart pounding hard inside her chest. It jolted her back to life and she screamed for her parents.

But no sound came out. She could feel her mouth moving. She felt her throat stretch and strain in her neck. But she didn’t hear anything. Not a sound.

She tried again, louder this time. Still no sound.

With horror she looked down at the tablet, her eyes widening. Beneath the first two green text bubbles were two new ones. These ones were blue.

""HELP!” they read. ""Help, help! Mom! Dad! Come here quick, something is wrong with the tablet! PLEASE!”

""<i>Time for a little more screen time, Jacinda.</i>”

381,10,4,,1,4.0,0.0,Jungle River Rush,"Tom and Jesse held on for their lives as they rushed down the river. The dense green jungle flashed by them on every side, so fast that it was little more than a blur! 

“I don’t know if I can hold on for much longer!” Jesse yelled, gripping the rubber raft handles tight.

They swerved around another sharp bend and almost hit a large rock sticking out of the river. The water’s frothy white spray came crashing over their heads, leaving them soaking wet. Tom looked up and saw two vines dangling from a low tree branch over the river’s course ahead. Looking farther downstream he saw a cluster of sharp rocks and then nothing. A drop-off. A waterfall.

“We’re going to have to grab those vines!” Tom screamed, summoning all his strength. Jesse whipped around to look where Tom was pointing.

“What are you, totally deranged?!?” he cried. “What do you think this is a movie or something? How are we supposed to–”

“JUMP!” Tom screamed, leaping into the air. The tree branch was right above them.

His fingers closed on the thick vine and he felt himself swinging through the air. His legs flailed helplessly above the roaring water. Then suddenly he saw land beneath him and let go, falling to the ground in a heap. Before he could look up to see what had happened to Jesse, something heavy landed on top of him.

“THAT WAS A TERRIBLE PLAN!” Jesse screamed, fumbling to get to his feet.

Tom smiled and got up too, wiping the dirt off of himself. “Yes it was. But we’re alive, aren’t we? Couldn’t have been too bad.”

He got all the ingredients ready then mashed them up in a bowl. Then he turned on the stove and took out a big pan. Grayson poured the mix into the pan in little circles. Soon it started to cook. 

He flipped the pancakes once. Success! Perfection!

Then his sister Jane came over. Jane started telling Grayson all about her Super Strawberry lip gloss. She waved it in front of his face and put it under his nose to sniff. But Grayson didn’t want his first ever banana pancakes to burn, so he told Jane to go away. 

“Fine!” Jane huffed, stomping away. “I’m going to have a tea party and <i>you’re</i> not invited!” She went to her room and closed the door.

Grayson checked his pancakes, but they still weren't ready yet. Suddenly his brother Ethan flew into the kitchen, attacking Grayson with a pillow. Grayson grabbed the pillow and threw it across the room. Ethan ran after it and came back laughing. 

“What are you doing?” he asked.

Grayson saw that his pancakes were finally done. “Banana pancakes,” he said. He switched off the stove and looked Ethan dead in the eye. “And you’re not having any.” Then Grayson turned back around and slid the pancakes onto a plate. 

“We’ll see about that…” Ethan mumbled. 

Grayson put the plate of pancakes down on the table. Then he walked across the room to the fridge and grabbed the maple syrup. Then he opened the drawer and pulled out a knife and fork. But when he got back to his plate, both Ethan and the plate of pancakes were gone!

Grayson looked around, but they were nowhere to be found. Just when Grayson was about to explode with anger, he heard a small laugh. <i>They must be nearby.</i>

He checked under the table, behind the couch, and even in the shower! Then he realised there was one place he had never checked. <i>The big cabinet under the sink.</i>

Grayson ran over to the cabinet. But before he got a chance to pull open the doors, Ethan burst out of it, giggling madly. Without looking back, Ethan wrenched open the front door and ran outside.

Grayson picked the empty plate up off the floor. There wasn’t even a crumb left.

390,10,5,,3,5.0,0.0,The Emergence of Ms. Vesser,"Inga was new on the street and Alexa was her new friend. The two were walking to the supermarket on an errand for Alexa’s mum with a crisp ten dollar bill. Alexa was smacking a large piece of gum as they went. Inga was telling Alexa about the house she used to live in. But then Alexa suddenly grabbed her arm and pulled her down behind a garbage can. 

“Hey, what are you–” Inga began. But Alexa held a finger over her mouth to tell her to be quiet. Then she carefully poked her head around the side.

She whispered back to Inga over her shoulder. “Come look,” she said. 

Inga crawled forward and peered out over Alexa’s head. She didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. Inga liked her new street. The houses were small and the sidewalks were cracked, but almost every single garden was exploding with flowers. Many of them had odd little stone statues of lions, or babies, or eagles too. From here Inga could see the tallest tree on the block, and the spot where Alexa had said that she broke her leg once. But all of that seemed normal.

“What are you talking about?” she whispered. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”

Alexa rolled her eyes. She jutted her finger out slightly, careful not to let it extend beyond the garbage can. Her eyes were wide and she seemed to be trying to point at something with her eyebrows. “Right. There. Her!” she mumbled through clenched teeth.

Inga looked out again where Alexa had pointed. She saw a woman about her mom’s age walking down her driveway to the sidewalk. She wore broken plastic sandals and red capris that seemed to just barely stretch across her sizeable backside. 

“Who’s that?” Inga whispered, crawling back to safety behind the garbage can.

“That’s Ms. Vesser,” Alexa replied, looking excited. “And in the entire twelve long years of my life, I’ve never EVER seen her leave her house. We’ve gotta follow her.”

397,2,3,,1,3.5,1.8,How To Build A Paper Airplane,"Step One: Get a rectangular piece of paper. Place it in front of you lengthwise.

Step Two: Fold the paper in half by bringing the left edge to meet the right edge. Press all along the fold to make a crease. You should be left with a tall, skinny rectangle.

Step Three: Open the paper back up again. There should be a crease running from top to bottom through the middle of the sheet.

Step Four: Fold the top left corner in towards the middle. One of its edges should line up with the middle crease. Press on the fold to make a crease. Repeat this step with the top right corner.

Step Five: Take the left edge of the sheet. Fold it so that the top half lines up with the center crease. Press along the fold to make a crease. Repeat this step with the right edge of the sheet. Your sheet should now be flat on the bottom, with a pointed top and two slanted sides.

Step Six: Take the left side of the sheet. Bring it to meet the right side, folding along the center crease. You should be left with a tall skinny rectangle.

Step Seven: Take the slanted edge of the rectangle. Fold it to meet the long, straight edge of the rectangle. Press on the fold to make a crease all the way down to the point. This will make a wing! Flip your paper over and repeat this step on the other side.

Step Eight: Lift the wings gently away from the other folds. And there you have it!

399,3,4,,1,4.4,3.8,How To Do Archeology,"Archeologists study cultures from the past by digging up old artifacts. But how do they do it?

Step One: Choose a site. It’s good to start with a site where you know people have been living for a long, long time. Better chances that you’ll find something good!

Step Two: Separate the site. It’s important to keep discoveries organized. To do this, sites are split up into grids and squares. That way you’ll know exactly where an item was found.

Step Three: Start digging! Grab a shovel or a pick and get dirty!

Step Four: Brush carefully. Once you think you’ve found something, slow down. Old artifacts can break very easily. Switch the shovel for a brush and uncover the item carefully.

Step Five: Store and record findings. Take pictures! Take measurements! Take notes! Gather as much data as possible from your discoveries. Then make sure to store them safely for future study.

Step Six: Study them at home/ the lab. Scientists can run tests to find out just how old your discovery is. The work of other experts might help uncover the mysteries of what you found. And your findings might help uncover some of their mysteries too!

Step Seven: Repeat! There is always more out there to learn and discover!

The day had been hot and the water was still warm. In fact, it was almost the exact temperature of Ayanna’s own skin. She felt almost like her body was floating through nothingness. A single loon called out from the surrounding trees. The sound echoed across the water.

Ayanna glided closer to the lake’s center. She thought about how terrible the day had been. She thought about how glad she was to be away from it all now, to be alone. She listened to the gentle sound of droplets falling from her fingertips back into the smooth water. 

Then she saw something bright bobbing towards her. She swam toward it and stopped, treading water. It was so bright that she had to squint to see its shape. It was a huge diamond! Looking around she suddenly noticed several others floating nearby. They were so beautiful, shimmering and winking in the blackness. They almost looked like stars fallen to Earth, Ayanna thought.

It was that very thought that made her look up. And what she saw there took her breath away. High above her she saw, not the sky, but the shore she had just left. She saw the tops of pointed green trees and the rocky bank of the lake. She saw the shining surface of the lake itself! She saw it all as though from high above. But how could that possibly be?

And it had seemed to slither. Kieran watched and waited. It wasn't a cartoon or a television program, of that he was absolutely certain.

He caught a glimpse of it once more, its tail whipping ferociously from side to side. It was slithering through the static, closer and closer. It was a humongous serpent! Kieran leaned away from the screen but didn’t dare take his eyes off it, even to blink. The snake was as thick as a sewer pipe and longer than he could see. It drew nearer and nearer and Kieran watched it unhinge its massive jaw, revealing rows of razor-sharp fangs. Suddenly it reared up and bolted forward and the TV screen bulged out at Kieran.

419,7,5,,4,5.1,4.5,The Rattling Coffin,"The coffin rattled again, and this time it didn’t stop.

Ed stared at it in horror. His eyes were wide and his hands were balled into tight sweaty fists at his sides. The coffin shook furiously, causing the dark wooden table beneath it to creak and groan. The tall pale flowers in vases on either end of it swayed and trembled. A wild pounding was coming from within the glossy black box, harder and harder until the sides began to shudder. Though the lid had been locked tight, it was starting to lift, inch by inch. A strange green light was leaking out through that gap under the lid. It was the light that scared Ed most of all. Years later when he lay down to sleep, he could still see it shining behind his eyelids.

The fish was flabby, and floppy, and lumpy, and it was crying. No, the fish was absolutely wailing. His name was Bob. Bob, the sobbing blobfish. 

Then, with one great throbbing sob (and a sound rather like that of a hog), Bob blew out a thick snot glob.

She is said to live off the east coast of the United States. Like Nessie, Chessie's name comes from a body of water. Chessie has most often been spotted in Chesapeake Bay– so they call her ""Chessie""! The first reported sighting was in 1936. The stories say Chessie is 40 feet long. She is reported to be dark brown or black in color. Reports describe the shape of her head as like a horse’s, or a football.

After a while, the Japanese began folding it into beautiful shapes. At first, paper was very costly. This meant that only wealthy people could make origami. Even then it was only made for special events. At weddings, origami butterflies represented the bride and groom. Warriors traded gifts of paper folded into symbols of good luck. As time went on, paper became less costly. This meant that origami was for everyone. Just like today!

But Umberto had to get across. Looking back over his shoulder he saw the riders thundering towards him. Across the moat the drawbridge stood fast against the castle wall, secure from unwanted intruders. Just above it was an empty guard’s lookout. But how could he get up there? He looked down at his discarded lance feeling panic rise in his throat. Then he had an idea.

He was so focused on keeping the bird in his sight as he ran that he didn’t notice a root sticking up at his feet. It caught the toe of his boot as he passed and he went tumbling through the crooked trees. 

After a moment, he got to his feet. He looked all around him but nothing looked familiar. The bird was gone. The forest was silent. Nicolas was lost.

It is said that golems can only be created by those close to God, like rabbis. A golem’s body is formed by molding inanimate materials. But a golem is brought to life by carving certain sacred Hebrew letters into its forehead. Other stories say that these letters must be inserted into the golem’s mouth. Once the golem is alive, it will do whatever its creator asks. Some legends tell of golems that became too large and dangerous. Luckily, if the sacred letters are removed from the golem, it crumbles back into dust.

Instead, three gigantic arched sails were propelling it forwards. They billowed gracefully. But it could not be wind that filled them, for there is no air in space. No, the ship's sails were filled not by wind, but by light. Dazzling light from billions of stars scattered through the nothingness. Their light shone bright enough to guide the ship to its endless fated destinations.

As it turned out, the stranger was special. The stranger was the friend of a powerful god. So he granted King Midas one wish for his kindness. King Midas wished that everything he touched would turn to gold. And so it did. But it was not the blessing he’d wanted. All his food turned to gold in his mouth. His roses turned to gold and fell from their bushes. Then one day his daughter ran into his arms. She turned to gold in an instant. King Midas cried. He cursed and he cried. He asked the stranger to turn back his wish. He would do anything to have his daughter back. So the stranger did it. And King Midas learned there are things much more valuable than gold.

Guartha moved quickly through it towards the tall canyon wall. 

Its smooth slate face rose up for miles above him, beyond sight. Right down the middle was a narrow, craggy opening. All looked pitch black within it. But Guartha knew where it led. Barely wide enough for his slender form, he squeezed through it. He swam for a long time through the darkness. He took care not to scrape against the rough rock sides. Finally he came to the opening on the other end. His eyes were greeted by the familiar sight: a riot of color and motion.

For one thing, in the house’s front yard stood the tallest tree on the block. And it wasn’t tallest by just a little bit, but by a whole lot. It was a blue spruce tree over 50 feet tall! (It seemed to grow a bit more everyday). Most of the other front yards on the block didn’t have trees at all. For another thing, the house was painted all kinds of crazy colors. The porch was clear sky blue and the brick was sunshine yellow, with apricot trim around the windows. Most of the other houses on the block were only painted one boring color (like beige). Last of all (and maybe oddest too), the house had a great spangled snake nailed to its porch railing. The snake was painted wood covered in strange small bits of junk that glinted in the sun. It stretched almost all the way around the porch and seemed to consider people as they walked by.

None of the neighbors liked that house at all.

But looking down her hands were still covered in tiny beige granules. She picked at them but they wouldn’t budge. She noticed vaguely that her heart had begun galloping faster. She dug into one palm with her nail, determined now to pry the sand free from her skin– and it finally came loose. 

But as it fell something else happened too. A small sinkhole opened up where the grain of sand had just been. Now more sand was cascading through it, and more and more, widening the sinkhole until the center of her hand was nothing but a gaping emptiness with sand flowing through it like some insane hourglass. Then her fingers began to crumble and float away on the air. Pri tried to run, and even made it a few hopeful steps before she collapsed. 

Ten minutes later the sun was just a smoldering sliver on the horizon and the beach was empty once more. A pair of flip flops and an old beach bag sat on the sand in the growing darkness. The corner of a beach towel fluttered gently on the breeze.

Birds of all shapes, sizes, colors, and species were suspended from ropes all around and above him. Most were frozen mid flight, their wings outstretched and still on the breezeless gallery air. Some were arranged in nesting positions, their glazed eyes staring but seeing nothing. 

He walked over to a black crowned crane whose feet were encased in shallow water that was really just plexiglass. He glanced at the information plaque then looked up into the bird’s wide pale eye. A chill ran down his spine. As he was turning to leave, a soft rustling made him look back. The crane’s head had tilted slightly and was now looking right at Calvin.

“Keep your little friends close,” it said, “next they’ll come for you.”

473,9,7,,1,7.6,,"""Dokkaebi""","""Dokkaebi” (doe-keh-bee) are a kind of goblin creature from Korean folklore. Dokkaebi appear in many forms, but are usually said to look impressive or scary– often arriving in a flash of large blue flames. These spirits are powerful and mischievous. They are as likely to play a trick on a passing human as they are to help them. Dokkaebi are formed when a spirit possesses an abandoned household item, or an object stained with human blood. They are known to sometimes carry magical items like an invisibility cloak or a club that can summon objects. 
	According to legends, dokkaebi are fantastic wrestlers, and are tough to defeat if they decide to challenge you. Some tales say their only weakness is their right side. Others say they only have one leg, and that can be their downfall. 
	But one story tells of an old man who tricked a dokkaebi into making him rich. He told the spirit that money was his greatest fear. The dokkaebi, seeking to frighten the man, threw bags and bags of money at him. Thinking he had won, the dokkaebi left, and the old man was richer than he ever could have dreamed!

Sometimes this trio seeks to trick the hero of the story, but sometimes it only means to test or challenge them. 
	Baba Yaga is a mysterious and supernatural being. She is known to live in a hut deep in the dark woods. Unlike a normal cabin, Baba Yaga’s house is said to stand on gigantic chicken legs. But apart from her living space, Baba Yaga also likes to travel in style. Most accounts of Baba Yaga say she flies around in an oversized mortar and pestle.

According to ancient tales, the Huma flies through the sky for its entire life, without ever landing or touching the ground. Many depictions of the Huma show it with no legs at all. Some stories say the bird is invisible, possibly because it flies so incredibly high. Other stories say that only a rare few have seen the Huma, but that even a brief glimpse brings lifelong happiness. 
	The Huma contains both male and female natures within its body. It is considered to be a compassionate and extremely lucky creature. Part of this reputation comes from the myth that anyone touched on the head or shoulders by the shadow of a Huma bird shall become king. For this reason many kings wore feathers on their turbans that were said to be taken from the great Huma bird.

The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.

But there <i>was</i> life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow. The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it.

It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks. They came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been his always.

The Canadian's last words produced a sudden revolution in my brain. I wriggled myself quickly to the top of the being, or object, half out of the water, which served us for a refuge. I kicked it. It was evidently a hard, impenetrable body, and not the soft substance that forms the bodies of the great marine mammalia. But this hard body might be a bony covering, like that of the antediluvian animals; and I should be free to class this monster among amphibious reptiles, such as tortoises or alligators.

Well, no! the blackish back that supported me was smooth, polished, without scales. The blow produced a metallic sound; and, incredible though it may be, it seemed, I might say, as if it was made of riveted plates.

There was no doubt about it! This monster, this natural phenomenon that had puzzled the learned world, and overthrown and misled the imagination of seamen of both hemispheres, it must be owned was a still more astonishing phenomenon, in as much as it was a simply human construction.

There was not a break, a crack, or a dint in them. The admirable projectile was not hurt by the intense deflagration of the powders, instead of being liquefied, as it was feared, into a shower of aluminium.

In the interior there was very little disorder on the whole. A few objects had been violently hurled up to the roof, but the most important did not seem to have suffered from the shock. Their fastenings were intact.

On the movable disc, crushed down to the bottom by the smashing of the partitions and the escape of the water, three bodies lay motionless. Did Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan still breathe? Was the projectile nothing but a metal coffin carrying three corpses into space?

After the second day the sea subsided slowly to a glassy calm. It is quite impossible for the ordinary reader to imagine those eight days. He has not, luckily for himself, anything in his memory to imagine with. After the first day we said little to one another, and lay in our places in the boat and stared at the horizon, or watched, with eyes that grew larger and more haggard every day, the misery and weakness gaining upon our companions. The sun became pitiless. The water ended on the fourth day, and we were already thinking strange things and saying them with our eyes; but it was, I think, the sixth before Helmar gave voice to the thing we had all been thinking. I remember our voices were dry and thin, so that we bent towards one another and spared our words. I stood out against it with all my might, was rather for scuttling the boat and perishing together among the sharks that followed us; but when Helmar said that if his proposal was accepted we should have drink, the sailor came round to him.

Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown <i>him</i> far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested.

You can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale, chinless faces and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!—as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had almost burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match … and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks, and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.

“That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean.

Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight.
	""The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now.

""I wonder if Phidias used to be contented with what he'd done?"" she thought. ""I suppose he was the greatest sculptor that ever lived. I remember reading that Millais once went to an exhibition of his own pictures, and came away very dejected. Shall I ask them all to come and see it now? I want so much to show it, but somehow I hardly dare. I almost think I'll leave it for somebody to find out, and just go back to the rink and say nothing.""

She had not counted, however, on Mabel, who, missing her friend for an unusual length of time, took off her skates and went to hunt for her, tracking her in the end by her footsteps in the snow. Mabel's amazement when she reached the lawn was only equalled by her admiration. She rushed off instantly to fetch all the girls to look, even venturing to knock at the study door and report her news at head-quarters.

Aldred's snow statue made quite a sensation at the Grange. Miss Drummond thought so highly of it that she had it photographed, and invited many of her friends from Chetbourne to come and see it. It was such a daring and original project for a girl of only fifteen to have carried out entirely alone that she felt it reflected credit on the school to possess so clever a pupil. Aldred was praised to her heart's content, and received so much attention from teachers and visitors that she could certainly consider herself, for the time being, the most important person at Birkwood. She was petted by the prefects, invited to skate by members of the Sixth Form who had ignored her existence before, and asked so often for her autograph that she grew almost tired of signing her name.

In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book, rubbing its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously. It seemed very stupid, and when Lionel gave it a push and said, ""Go along and fight the Dragon, do,"" it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and hid behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were asleep it went around and ate all the pussy-cats in the town. And then it mewed more than ever. And on the Saturday morning, when people were a little timid about going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for calling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the milk that was left in the cans at the doors for people's teas, and it ate the cans as well.

And then and there, while yet he was undiscovered, the likely lad made up his mind, as he should have done long before, to leave those colossal emeralds where they were and have nothing further to do with the lean, high house of the gnoles, but to quit this sinister wood in the nick of time and retire from business at once and buy a place in the country. Then he descended softly and beckoned to Nuth. But the gnoles had watched him through knavish holes that they bore in trunks of the trees, and the unearthly silence gave way, as it were with a grace, to the rapid screams of Tonker as they picked him up from behind—screams that came faster and faster until they were incoherent. And where they took him it is not good to ask, and what they did with him I shall not say.

Nuth looked on for a while from the corner of the house with a mild surprise on his face as he rubbed his chin, for the trick of the holes in the trees was new to him; then he stole nimbly away through the dreadful wood.

But some plants live off of trapping and consuming bugs or small animals. These special varieties are called “carnivorous plants,” and they use many different techniques to catch their meals.

The Venus flytrap looks like a wide-open mouth, but its interior surfaces are covered with tiny sensitive hairs. If any intruder touches a hair twice within twenty seconds, the trap is triggered and the “mouth” snaps shut on its prey. 

The cobra lily’s leaves fill with water and lure small bugs in. However, its translucent, window-like leaves disguise the way out of the plant, leaving the bugs inside trapped and confused.

The many species of sundew all form small dewy orbs on the tips of their leaves to entice thirsty bugs. But rather than water, those drops are actually made of a sticky glue-like substance that holds the captured insect until the plant can digest it.

Perhaps most menacing of all is the pitcher plant, which can lure whole frogs to fall from their slippery leaves into the depths of their “pitcher” to drown. All that is left of these unfortunate frogs are their “slippers”: the discarded feet which are the only part of the frog the plant cannot digest.

All of this happens through root systems and fungi beneath the soil!

626,3,8,,1,8.9,0.0,Chinese Imperial Exams,"Standardized testing has a very long history in China. It began as early as the Han Dynasty! By 165 BCE, passing an imperial exam was required for certain positions. These written tests were used to select hard-working government officials. The exams did not focus on knowledge related to a given position. Instead, most testing surrounded the teachings of Confucius (a philosopher of great importance to Chinese culture). Critics claim that the exams fostered conformity, rather than creativity. Supporters say they promoted strong cultural unity and the virtue of education. Either way, the exams were incredibly rigorous.

Testing took place over the course of three days. During these three days, examinees wrote the test in small cells. They also ate all their meals and slept in those cells. They were not allowed to communicate with their peers. Because pressure to pass was so high, some participants resorted to cheating. Some tried to bribe the examiners. Others wrote out cheat sheets on their underwear!

The Chinese abolished imperial exams in 1905. However, the idea of standardized exams is still popular today.

627,3,8,,1,8.2,0.0,Sakoku,"In 1633, Japan was being ruled by its final feudal government or ""shogunate.” Shogunates were led by a ""shogun,"" a military dictator who held almost absolute power. At this time, the shogunate was run by the Tokugawa family clan. 
	Up to this point, Japan had been a rising attraction for foreign trade. Though global attention had some benefits, it also came with problems. Trade with other countries invited piracy, which flared along Japan’s coasts. It also sped the arrival of Catholicism from Spain and Portugal. European influence soon took root in the south of Japan, and was spreading. 
	The shogunate did not like this at all. They did not like the erosion of traditional Japanese culture. Perhaps more than that, they saw the colonial influence as a threat to their power. 
	The shogun in 1633, Tokugawa Iemitsu, took drastic action. In order to stop this ""cultural invasion,” he enacted a sakoku, a strict policy to isolate Japan from the rest of the world. The word ""sakoku” means ""closed country.” Under the sakoku, trade and migration were strictly limited. Most foreigners were not allowed into the country. Japanese nationals were not allowed out. The sakoku held for 220 years. 
	It finally came to and end in 1853 when American ""Black Ships"" sailed to Japan. They threatened force if trade was not reopened. One year later, a treaty was signed.

628,3,7,,1,7.6,0.0,The Disappearance of the Ancient Olmecs,"The Olmecs were an ancient people that thrived between 1500 BCE and 400 BCE. They lived in the tropical region of modern-day Mexico. The Olmec people had a very rich society and culture: They had widespread systems of trade; They farmed maize, beans, and squash; They built basic aqueducts and pyramids; They were master sculptors; They had a complex religion with many rituals and gods. Their culture had a huge influence on later societies. And influence was all that was left– because the Olmecs disappeared.
	Around 400 BCE, the major Olmec cities were abandoned, and no one knows why. Many scholars agree that the environment was likely a major cause. Some believe that Olmec farming techniques left too much silt in their rivers. Others think that changes in climate or tectonic shifting affected their crops. Some experts say that an erupting volcano was the culprit! For now, the end of this great society remains a mystery.

Given their vast knowledge of history, griots sometimes even acted as special advisors to royal families and rulers!

In fact, salt was <i>so</i> valuable that it was literally traded for its weight in gold! 
	The mines north of Ghana produced salt, and the mines to the south produced gold. The clever rulers of Ghana saw an opportunity here: facilitate trade between the north and the south and reap all the rewards! The Empire of Ghana became the center of trade in the region, even extending its reach to trade across the Sahara Desert.

Suddenly both options seemed unavoidably and horrifyingly awkward. Luckily it didn’t seem to matter because not one of the girls turned their head so much as a fraction of an inch as Dina drew nearer. They were definitely focused on something, it seemed, but it wasn’t her.

Feeling more and more panicked and insane for having put herself in this bizarre position with a bunch of strangers, Dina finally found her (suddenly very tremulous) voice. “Hi hello I’m Dina where– what are you all looking at?”

Nothing.

“Uh, I hang out here a lot but I’ve never noticed you here before, do you, uh, go to parks a lot? I mean, this one? ‘Cause like, um, like I said I haven’t seen you here and I’m here like pretty much all the time, or like, a normal amount of time.” 

Still nothing. 

Dina stared into the intricate twin braids lining the back of one of the girls’ heads. She was getting really frustrated now and could feel the nervous anticipation turning to anger in her throat. Why did these girls think they were so much better than her anyway? As if she didn’t deserve even a single moment of their precious attention? Where exactly did they get off with that– they didn’t even know her! 

Dina stormed around the picnic table to look at them– no, to force <i>them</i> to look at <i>her</i> just for one minute, and to listen. But when she came around to the other side of the table she stopped dead. Her mouth hung open and had gone bone dry once more. 

Standing on that side of the table, she stared in horror at that same pair of intricate twin braids. The girls hadn’t moved– Dina hadn't taken her furious gaze off of them– yet somehow she was looking at the back of their heads again. But their bodies were still turned towards her! It was all so grotesque and somehow she could still read the phrase on the front of one of their tshirts: <i>Say it again and I’ll pretend like I care.</i>

Legend says that Camazotz was in the House of Bats when the Maya Hero Twins had to journey through it in the underworld. The cave was so full of bats that the Twins had to hide themselves inside their own blow dart tubes to stay safe. After many hours, one of the Twins stuck his head out of the tube to see if it was safe to come out, but Camazotz flew down and chomped his head right off! Then, adding insult to injury, Camazotz brought the head to a ballgame to be used as the ball!

Pandora was given many beautiful gifts, including one box that was locked tight. Zeus didn’t tell her what was inside, but told her that she was not to open it under any circumstances. One day Pandora’s curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box. All the worst and darkest forces came streaming out: Hate, Envy, Illness, Death. Pandora tried to shut the lid again but it was too late, its contents had been released into the world forever. Most versions of the story say that Hope was inside that box too. Some say Hope was the only thing left trapped in the box when Pandora shut the lid again. Others say that Hope escaped too, and is the only thing we have to fight against those dark forces.

Beads of milky liquid clung to the dark red rock of the low ceiling and trickled down the rough walls. In the hollow center of the table, a human baby lay sleeping. A delicate forcefield of shimmering light cloaked it like a second skin. 

<i>Earth creatures cannot survive longer than a couple of days in our lands</i>, one member of The Council thought. <i>How did this small and unformed one get here?</i>

<i>And what in the name of Kukumao are we meant to do with it now</i>, another replied.

She knew that the science behind her hypothesis was unshakable, because she had researched it herself. She had double and triple checked the theory and the data. She must have performed hundreds of experiments of all kinds before now– but there was something definitely different about being the subject of the experiment. It gave her a whole new respect for guinea pigs.

Nonetheless she turned on her LabCam and noted the time in her log book: 24/05/19 16:04. The camera’s red light started blinking below the dark, staring lens. It was like a timer counting down to lift off. 

Now or never.

Marieke took a deep breath, switched on the accelerator, and stepped onto the landing pad. A high whine filled her ears. Then– CRACK!

David took a step backwards, dumbfounded by where all his searching had led him and wishing more than anything that he had never started looking in the first place. But before he could turn to run, the scaly tip of a gargantuan tail thudded down behind him blocking his way. 

David stared up into the Lizard King’s face once more. Dozens of smaller, bonier lizards were crawling all over it. Fine, fiery circles of gold encircled the wide black holes of its pupils. David looked into those merciless eyes and knew he would never see the sunlight again.

Some versions of the story claim that in order to secure his position as the ruler of Cusco, Manco Cápac turned all three of his brothers to stone!

Some historians believe the legends of Manco Cápac were exaggerated stories based on a real person. Others think they were simply myths that glorified the origins of the Inca people.

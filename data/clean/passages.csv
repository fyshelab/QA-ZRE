11,12,7,3,"“Joey, run!” she screamed. But Joey seemed to be unable to take his eyes away from the snake.

12,13,10,3,"“Good luck, boy!” she said, and her voice only shook a little. The dog rubbed her hand with his head before bounding into the night.

20,21,8,3,"Under the magnifying glass, Edwin found a small purple feather. “To the zoo!” he cried. “No wait– to the costume room!”
"
21,22,10,3,"Mei dripped onto the tiled floor as she waited her turn. She counted four kids ahead of her in line for the diving board. <i>Maybe someone will pull the fire alarm before it gets to me</i>, she thought. <i>Or maybe one of the little kids will pee in the pool and turn it all purple and everyone will have to get out</i>. <i>Is that thing about turning the water purple even real?</i> There was a giant splash to her left. She took a step forward. Three kids ahead of her now. Her goggles felt weirdly tight on her head and were pulling her hairs. Voices and laughter echoed off the walls all around her. Another big splash. Two kids ahead of her now. <i>Why am I even doing this? I could just go back to the shallow end right now. </i>But she didn’t move. She watched the girl at the top leap off the board’s edge and curl herself into a cannon ball. The splash sent water running over Mei’s feet. <i>People do this all the time, right? It can’t be that bad, right? RIGHT?</i> She watched a pair of dripping feet climb the ladder in front of her. The smell of chlorine felt like it was stuck inside her nose. Another big splash. Mei’s turn.

25,26,10,3,"The family was playing hide-and-seek. Grandma closed her eyes and started counting. Mom went to hide. Dad went to hide. Sarah went to hide. Mom hid in the closet. Dad hid behind the curtains. Sarah hid under the coffee table. They waited and waited in their hiding places. Grandma never came! Finally, Mom, Dad, and Sarah came out of their hiding places. They went to go find Grandma. They walked into the living room and saw Grandma on the couch. Grandma was fast asleep!
"
26,27,11,3,"Mandisa stopped running just in time. She swung out her left arm and caught the others as they ran up beside her. All of them were breathing hard. They had stopped right in front of a huge field of lasers. Thin beams of red light shot in every direction as far as the eye could see. 

“What is this place?” asked Fatima.

Mandisa looked around, trying to catch her breath. The room they were in was like a long, strange hallway. The ceiling was very low. All of the walls and floors were tiled with some smooth, shiny black material like glass. There was no way through the hall except to go through the lasers. She could hear the low buzzing hum they made.

Femi seemed to have noticed their problem too. “What do you think would happen if we touch them?” she said, looking at the red beams.

“Worst case they burn a hole through us.” Mandisa said. “Best case they set off some kind of alarm to tell everyone where we are. Either way I don’t want to find out.” But then Mandisa noticed a gap between the beams right in front of her. There was a narrow path through. She stepped into the gap and the others gasped. Now she could see other open paths through the lasers on either side of her. “It’s a maze,” she said.

“What?” said Fatima. “We can’t go through there! What if we choose the wrong way? We could be trapped!”

“We don’t have any choice,” Mandisa said. “They’re coming.”

"
29,30,10,3,"It was Li’s first time at summer camp, and so far it was okay - except for the bathroom. The bathroom wasn’t really a bathroom at all - it was an outhouse! You had to walk through the forest to get to it, and it was dark and smelly and full of spiders. Li’s least favorite time was when she had to go at night. The walk through the forest seemed twice as long. The outhouse was twice as dark. And at night, it probably even had twice as many spiders in it!

These were Li’s thoughts as she walked down the path her second night at camp. She was not looking forward to using the outhouse. And she was looking forward to it even less when she got there and heard a weird noise coming from inside. It sounded like a wailing ghost!

Li waited a bit, but she didn’t hear the noise again. Finally she decided she would just have to brave it. After all, it was already full of spiders. A ghost could hardly make it worse. Li took a deep breath (but not too deep, because of the smell) and opened the door.

Inside was a girl! Li looked carefully, but she didn’t seem to be a ghost. In fact, she looked like one of the girls in Li’s cabin. She also looked like she had been crying.

“I h-h-hate it here,” the girl said.

“I hate it in the outhouse too,” said Li. “But the cabin is much better.”

“No, I mean I hate it at camp!” the girl said. “I never make friends. There are so many other girls. I always feel like everyone is watching me and waiting for me to do something silly. This is the only place I feel safe.”

Li thought for a minute. “Would it help if we became friends?” she said. The girl looked at her. Then she sniffed and nodded.

“Okay. One one condition,” said Li. “I’m never hanging out in the outhouse again!”

30,31,3,3,"Did you know that the ancient Romans used to use human pee as mouthwash and laundry soap? Urine (a.k.a. pee), has ammonia in it which works well as a cleanser! But still– yuck!
"
31,32,11,3,"Noah closes the door to his room. But it isn’t a normal door, and it isn’t a normal room. Your door is probably rectangular and white. Noah’s door is round and silver and shiny. Your room might be filled with toys. Noah’s room is filled with beeping and flashing machines. This is because Noah is an alien! He lives on a spaceship. Once, Noah saw a picture of a room just like yours. He thought it looked pretty weird. “Where are the beeping machines?” he said. “Why is the door a rectangle?”

32,33,10,3,"The bush was rustling so much, it sounded as if a big bear was inside. Then a tiny white kitten came crawling out.
"
33,34,5,3,"In a far away land, in a far away time, there lived a proud old king. The king was <i>so</i> proud that he believed that he controlled the moon and the sun. He loved to shout about his powers from the castle’s tallest towers.

“The moon only shines because I make it so!” he cried to knights and servants. “The sun only rises each day on my orders!” 

People always nodded politely. It was not wise to argue with the king. Then, one day, a wandering jester came to the kingdom. Right away he heard the king’s bragging. It made him laugh. So, he went to the castle wall and called up to the king.

“If you can make the sun rise and the moon shine,” he yelled, “then why don’t you just prove it?”
"
34,35,11,3,"Alfy rolled his wheelchair into the middle of the hallway, blocking his big sister’s path. 

“Come on! Just hear me out,” he said.

Selena crossed her arms and looked at him. “Okay,” she sighed. “Tell me about this great invention of yours.”

Alfy grinned and spun his chair to face her. He spread out his arms on either side of him dramatically. “Rocks!” he cried. “I call it the If-Rocks-Could-Talk-Project!”

Selena raised her eyebrows. “Rocks?” she said. “Talking rocks? Alfy, I love you, but I think your head is full of rocks.”

“Just think about it!” he said. “Rocks are just about the oldest things on Earth. If we had some way of talking to them, imagine what they could tell us! They could tell us about the beginning of the planet! They could tell us about creatures we never even knew were real! They could tell us about the world’s most ancient people and how they lived! They could tell us everything!”

Selena looked interested now. “I guess it’s not a totally wacko idea,” she said. “But still, rocks aren’t alive, Alfy! They can’t even talk to each other, let alone us. There’s no way you’ve made a gadget that can do that.”

Alfy’s eyes twinkled with excitement. “But I have!” he said. “Or, at least I’m pretty sure that I have. I really really think my invention is going to work. I just need your help to test it!”

35,36,5,3,"Once upon a time, there was a man who felt too small. Oddly, he was already over 76 feet tall!

36,37,8,3,"“Or maybe the butler did it!” Inspector Singh cried. The butler stopped in his tracks, dropped the tea tray, and ran from the room.

37,38,7,3,"When they looked behind them, the tall, dark figure was closer than ever. They started to run.
"
38,39,11,3,"Simon stared at the alien that sat on the metal table in the lab. It looked like an upside down jujube with a mouth. It didn’t have any eyes, but it’s wide mouth was smiling. It jiggled happily back and forth making odd squeaks. 

Professor Dinkluss looked at the strange creature and scratched his chin. “Well, I’ve done some tests,” he said. “And a few things are clear now.” He waved at Simon to come closer.

“I...think I’m okay back here for now. Thanks,” said Simon. 

“Suit yourself,” said the professor. He went on. “The first thing was to find out what it eats. That was not as easy as it might sound.”

“Picky eater, huh?” Simon said. 

“Exactly,” replied the professor. “I tried feeding it meat: steak, jerky, ham, spam, burgers, sushi. Nothing. No interest. Then I tried vegetables and fruits: broccoli, sprouts, raspberries, bananas. It sucked on a turnip for a while, but then spit it out. I tried blue cheese, and cotton candy, fried eggs, and chewing gum. I tried grass and tree bark and metal nails and nail polish. None of it was any good.” He smiled. “But then I finally figured it out.”

“So, what does it eat then?” Simon asked.

“Sunlight.” the professor said simply.

“Sunlight? How is that possible? No creature can <i>eat</i> sunlight!” Simon said.

“Oh no?” said the professor, curling an eyebrow. “Can’t you think of some living creatures on our own planet who do just that? Who use sunlight as their main source of energy to grow?”

Simon frowned, thinking. Then with a jolt, he realized. 

“Plants!” he cried. “Plants are sunlight eaters too!”

39,40,8,3,"“This room hasn’t been unlocked in 25 years,” Imogen said, turning the key. Dev went in and sat in an armchair. It was warm.
"
40,41,8,3,"“But why did you want to ruin the school play in the first place?” asked Principal Primbus.

“Because I should have been the star!” Tracey shouted. “Those kids got all the limelight, so I gave them a whole bunch of limes, too!”

Wanda rolled her eyes. “If you knew it was her this whole time, you sure kept it to yourself,” she said.
"
42,43,4,3,"There was a prince from a different land in Tyrell’s bedroom, and the prince was not happy. “I am a prince!” he yelled. “I command you to bring me all the best things!” 

Tyrell looked nervously at the door. What if someone heard? He didn’t know how he’d explain the magical portal the prince came through, or the other lands, or the prince himself, who had sparkly skin and purple hair. 

“Shhh,” Tyrell said. He sat the prince on his fluffiest pillow. 

“You expect a prince to sit on a pillow?” the prince yelled. “In my land, princes only sit on the floor!” He sat down on the floor. 

“Okay, okay,” Tyrell said. He snuck out, and brought back the prince some juice in his mom’s fanciest cup. 

“NO!” the prince screeched. Tyrell stopped him from throwing the cup at the last minute. “In my land, princes only drink water! Out of dirty tin cans!” 

This land sure sounds weird, Tyrell thought. He looked around, trying to find something the prince would like. In the corner were his oldest, smelliest socks. They had holes in them. They were grey. And they smelled really bad. He handed them to the prince. The prince took a long sniff of the socks. Slowly, he pulled them onto his purple feet. Tyrell watched nervously. Then, “These...are...AMAZING!” screamed the prince. It seemed he had got what he wanted: the portal opened up again behind him, and he jumped through. Tyrell got one last whiff of the socks, and then the prince was gone.

43,44,4,3,"Luis looked around. He saw ogres, giants, elves, fairies, and a dragon - but not his best friend Davy.
"
44,45,5,4,"Once upon a time, there was a town where no one ever made a sound. Until the day the musician came. 
"
45,46,4,4,"The tooth fairy sighed. She still had more than sixty teeth to collect, and it was already past midnight. She flapped her tiny, tired wings and flew across the quiet streets. On one side she carried a bag full of coins. On the other was her bag full of baby teeth. The bags brushed the windowsill as she flew into the next child’s bedroom.

But what she saw inside made her stop suddenly in mid-air. What was this? There was already someone pulling a tooth out from under this child’s pillow! It couldn’t be another fairy - they had no interest in teeth. That was her job! She flew closer.

It was a little brown mouse. As she watched, it pulled a coin out of its mouse-sized backpack and pushed the money under the pillow. Then it carefully put the tooth in the backpack and zipped it up.

The tooth fairy couldn’t stand it anymore. She was supposed to be collecting that tooth! “What are you doing?” she said, in a whisper that was more of a shout.

The mouse looked up. “Oh, I’m sorry, are you here for the tooth?” it said. “You see, I’m the French tooth fairy. And this child is French. So this is actually <i>my</i> job.”

“But...but this is my area! I’m supposed to collect that tooth!” the tooth fairy said. She flew slowly down to the bed beside the child’s pillow.

The mouse shrugged its tiny mouse shoulders. “But this is a French tooth,” it said.

The tooth fairy couldn’t think of anything to say to that. The two small tooth fairies stared at each other. Then the child turned over in its sleep and broke the spell. The mouse ran smoothly up the desk to the window. The fairy flew up after it. They both stood on the windowsill for a moment, looking out at the moonlit night.

“Actually - can I ask you where you got that backpack?” the tooth fairy said finally. “These bags are really heavy and hard to fly with.”

“Oh! Of course!” said the mouse.

And just like that, they were friends.

49,50,6,4,"Yuuto had just gotten home from school. He was still taking off his shoes and his backpack when the knock came at the door.

“Come in!” his mother called out in Japanese. Yuuto looked at the door, but no aunts or uncles came rushing in.

Then his mother tried English. “Come in!” But the door still didn’t open - no neighbours asking to borrow some sugar, or school friends asking him to come play.

Yuuto’s mother came rushing into the hall and frowned at him. “Ayaa, what are you doing? Don’t just stand there! Open the door!” She reached for the doorknob.

Yuuto would always remember that moment. His mother’s hands were covered in rice flour, and he still only had one shoe off. As the door swung open, the sound of birds came in on the breeze. Two men in uniform were standing on the porch.

“Mrs. Nakamura? You and your family are being sent to an internment camp,” one of them said. They didn’t look at Yuuto. “You have ten days.”

56,57,5,4,"Where I come from, there is only one very old story. This story has been handed down from mother to daughter and from father to son. Nobody knows when it was first told. Perhaps it has <i>always</i> been told. It is the story of the Coat Woman. 

People say that the Coat Woman lives deep in the dark forest. Some people say she lives in the heart of a tree. Others say that she sleeps under the river. Only a very few souls have actually seen her. Or at least, only a few have been able to come back and tell about it.

She is tall. Very tall, for a woman (if that is what she is). She has dark glossy hair. The top half of her face is as pale as the moon. Nobody has ever seen the bottom half. It is always covered by the large collar of her great and mysterious coat. 

She is never seen without the coat. It seems to be too big for her. It falls all the way down to her feet and drags on the ground behind her. The sleeves are wide and sweeping. It is always said to be made of some thick, heavy material, but the color is disputed. Some people say the coat looks dark and soft like moss. Others say it is as pale and layered as the fog. One rare tale tells of the coat glowing like the light reflecting off a cat’s eye in the night.

But what is on the outside of the coat is less troubling than what lies on the inside. Some people think she has no body at all. The woman never speaks, but strange sounds come from under that coat: the calls of birds that don’t exist, the howling of strong winds, a chime that reminds you of something you lost in childhood. Nobody knows what is under her coat. Nobody wise wants to know. So if you ever see her in the deep, dark forest, don’t let your curiosity get the best of you. Or else the Coat Woman might get the best of you too.

58,59,5,4,"There once was a man who lived by the sea. He was a poor and honest fisherman. One day he was out fishing in his small boat. Suddenly, he felt something large tugging on his fishing line. Slowly and carefully he reeled it in. With a great pull he lifted it into the boat. It was a gigantic fish! It was like nothing he had ever seen before! It had sparkling rainbow scales and a long swishing tail. 

The fisherman was so happy! When he sold this fish in the market, he would be rich!

But then the fish looked up at him and said, “Please, good fisherman. Do not take me from my home in the water. It is not yet my time to go!”

The fisherman looked back at the fish. The fish looked very sad. The fisherman knew that the fish was right: it was not his time to go. So, the fisherman gave up his dreams of riches with a sigh. Then he threw the fish back into the water.

“Thank you so much!” cried the fish as it splashed down beside the boat. “For your kindness I will always owe you a favor. And I will be glad to give it to you when the time comes.” Happily, the fish swam away.

Many years passed and the fisherman got older. One day he was out on his boat when a storm suddenly hit. The sky went dark and the wind started howling. The fisherman wasn’t strong enough row against the large waves. His eyes weren’t clear enough see the shore. 

Then suddenly the rainbow fish appeared! Its head popped out of the water beside the boat and it said: “Hello again, kind fisherman! I have not forgotten that you saved my life all those years ago. Now it is my turn to help you!”

And so the fish pulled the fisherman in his boat all the way back to shore. When he was safely back on land, he waved his thanks to the fish. The fisherman and the fish became great friends, for the rest of their lives. And that was all the riches they needed.

59,60,7,4,"Ari is having the dream again. The worst dream of all. It’s the dream where she is standing in front of the whole class, about to give a presentation. The teacher is waiting for her to talk. The whole class is waiting for her to talk. But she can’t seem to start. Just like always, Ari looks to her left and sees the teacher. The teacher looks impatient. Just like always, Ari looks out at the class. Some of them also look impatient. Some of them look like they think it’s funny. Some of them just look bored. Why can’t she start talking?

Ari tries to open her mouth, but it won’t open. She raises her hand to her mouth - but there’s nothing there. It’s just a smooth stretch of skin where her mouth should be. Now Ari is really scared. This isn’t how the dream normally goes! Usually she wakes up by now. She tries to say something, but only a muffled sound comes out. She looks out at the class again. Now they all have only one look: terrified. She realizes that all of their mouths are growing over with skin. The teacher struggles and grabs her face, but it doesn’t help: she can’t say a word either. One girl at the back of the class lets out one last scream before her mouth is gone completely.

It’s that scream that wakes Ari up. She lies there for a second, breathing heavily. What a bad dream! She puts her hand to her mouth, to make sure everything is back to normal. And that’s when she starts trying to scream for real - but nothing comes out…
"
60,61,7,4,"Sierra sat in her room upstairs. Her big sister was at a friend’s house. Her parents were out. It was dark outside, and the branches of the big trees in the backyard tapped on the window. But Sierra was old enough to stay home alone. That meant she was brave enough to stay home alone too.

Then she heard a noise downstairs.

“Rrrrreeeeeennnnnnnh.”

It sounded like a monster. No - a witch! A screaming, creepy witch.

“RrrreeeEEENNNnnnnh.”

Sierra turned up her music and tried to ignore it. But it cut through the comforting sounds.

“RrrEEEENNNNNH.”

It sounded like it was coming from the kitchen.

Sierra got up all her courage. She turned off the music and cracked open her bedroom door. The house was quiet. Could she have imagined it? She crept into the hallway. It was dark, but a single light from the kitchen glowed at the bottom of the stairs.

“RrrreennnNNNNhhhh!”

Sierra jumped! There was definitely a witch down there in the kitchen. She had thought she was too old to believe in witches, but this was proof they existed. Nothing else could be making a noise like that. Sierra could picture the witch perfectly. She knew it would be crouched in the corner, beside the counter. It would have black robes and a horrible, warty nose. And it would reach out its crooked, bony fingers towards her…

Sierra took a deep breath. No matter what, the witch was going to get her. But she had to see it first. She tiptoed very, very quietly down the stairs. The yellow light glowed through the railing. Slowly, the kitchen came into view. The tile floor...no witch yet. The microwave...still no witch. The dishwasher, the counter, the corner…

Sierra stopped, still crouched on the stairs. Where was the witch? Was it invisible? Had it magically moved behind her? Was she about to feel those bony fingers on her shoulder?

“RRRRREENNNNNNNHHHHH!”

Sierra screamed! Then she stopped. Because even though the noise sounded louder and even more horrible up close, it wasn’t coming from a witch.

“Reennh. Rreennh. Clack. Clang. Sploosh. Sploosh.”

It was just the old, creaky dishwasher, finishing washing a load of dishes.

61,62,7,4,"The dollhouse sat alone on the sidewalk corner. Jamal got off his bike and walked towards it. There was no moon that night and it was dark. The <i>tik-tik-tik</i> of the bike wheel was the only sound on the street.

The house had only three sides so that he could look right into it. It had three floors and lots of little rooms. The outside was dirty and scratched but the inside was shiny and looked brand new. Jamal had never played with a dollhouse before. He leaned in closer to look at the little kitchen and the little bedroom. He liked the tiny lamps. He liked the tiny fridge with the even tinier fridge magnets. He slowly reached out a finger to touch a tiny milk jug– but then he heard people whispering. He turned quickly but saw no one. He was alone on the street. 

Jamal turned back towards the dollhouse. One of the tiny lamps was glowing with a soft, yellow light. Had that light been on before? The whispering began again. Suddenly Jamal wanted to have this dollhouse more than anything in the world. He needed to have it. It was his.

62,63,10,4,"William was allergic to just about everything. He couldn’t have peanut butter, and he couldn’t roll in the grass. He couldn’t eat at most restaurants, and he had to sleep with a special machine to filter the air in his room. Normally, that stuff didn’t bother William. He was used to it. But there was one big problem. He couldn’t have pets! He was allergic to cats, to dogs, to hamsters and even to birds. Mama Jules was scared of snakes, and Mama Steph said no to a pig. “Just a small one!” said William, but she said you never know how big they’d grow. 

That weekend, William told his aunt his problems. “I have just the thing for you,” she said. “Hop in the car.” They drove right past the pet store and into the suburbs. 

“Aquarium store?” said William when they stopped. “Aren’t fish kind of boring?” 

“Wait and see,” his aunt said, holding open the door. 

Inside there were tanks from floor to ceiling. There were more fish than William had ever seen - and they weren’t boring at all! They came in every color and every size and every shape. 

“Whoa,” said William.

After a moment, a purple splat joined it. Adish lifted his head. He had found the missing popsicles!

64,65,11,4,"Logan’s parents had a very important job. They travelled to different planets to learn about the different people who lived on each one. They would stay long enough to write down all the facts, and then they would have to zoom off to another planet. Logan hated it. “Every time we go to a new planet, I have to learn all the jokes the kids have there. Then we move and I have to learn a bunch of new ones!” he complained. Logan’s mom and dad looked at him seriously. “Logan, I think I have an idea,” his dad said. Now, Logan has a very important job. He writes down facts about each planet, just like his parents - but his facts are a little different. He is keeping track of all the jokes he learns! Now when he moves, he soon has all the kids on his new planet laughing. “Tell us more!” they say. And Logan always does.

66,67,4,4,"Marcus was walking through the forest singing to the butterflies. Suddenly, he heard a noise in the bushes behind him. He turned around to find the strangest creature he had ever seen. The creature looked sort of like a very small old man. It had thin limbs and pale greyish skin. Its head was wider than a normal person’s, and its large eyes were a deep, glittering purple. Oddly enough, the creature did not seem to walk on its feet. Its scrawny arms held up its body while its legs were crossed and twisted like a pretzel behind its head. But strangest of all were the toenails growing from those feet: they were yellow, and jagged, and so long that they curled into spirals at the ends!

“What are you lookin’ at?” the thing growled at Marcus.

“Nothing!” Marcus replied at once. “I’ve just never seen a creature like you before.”

“Oh yeah?” it said. “We’re a rare kind. The world can’t handle too much of a beautiful thing, you know.” It carefully dug around in one nostril with the tip of a gnarled toenail.

“I...I guess not.” said Marcus. He turned to leave.

“You can call me Teegy,” the creature said, shuffling towards Marcus. He proudly extended a filthy, lumpy foot. (Marcus was relieved it wasn’t the foot with the booger still hanging off the end.) “Teegy of the Geegersneegers.”

Marcus looked at the foot and swallowed. A bad, sweet smell like rotting fruit was coming from it. Still, he took the foot in his hand and shook it, trying to smile. “Um, it’s nice to meet you, Teegy. I’m Marcus the Wanderer.”

67,68,10,4,"Ava opened up her lunch box, feeling hungry. But as soon as she saw what was inside, she lost her appetite. First, she pulled out a tuna and chocolate sauce sandwich. Next, she found a melting piece of blue cheese with soy sauce on top! Instead of her juice box, she found a tin of grey goop that smelled like rubber tires (she didn’t dare find out what it tasted like!). But worst of all was what she found for dessert. Today in her lunch there was no cake, or cookies, or pudding. Instead, when she reached in her hand to pull out dessert, all she found there was….apple slices!

“The horror!” Ava yelled across the cafeteria. “Who could do such a terrible thing to a child? I shall never eat again!”

68,69,7,4,"The vines were just growing and growing– they wouldn’t stop! They coiled around Beth’s ankles so she couldn’t run. They spiraled up her legs like strong green snakes. They grew and grew, faster and faster! The vines wound around her torso. Beth struggled hard, trying to fight them off. But every time her fist broke free, more vines sprouted up and pinned her arms back down! They were like evil, living ropes! Beth could hear them rustling in her hair beside her ears. And then suddenly all she could see was green, and then black. They were growing over her eyes! She opened her mouth wide to scream but the vines were too quick! They grew over her mouth until her scream was no more than a muffled moan. Now Beth blended in perfectly with the other plants on the forest floor. Just the way they liked it.

71,72,2,4,"Have you ever heard an elephant sing? Of course you haven’t! That’s because while they <i>do</i> sing– but it’s too low for us to hear! Elephants sing just like people do. They blow air through a voice box in their throat to make sounds. The sound that comes out is a rumble so low that human ears can’t hear it. If only we had big floppy ones like them!

Elephants sing to each other for different reasons. They sing to each other to keep the herd together. They sing to find each other if they have gotten lost. They even sing to find mates! I think humans do that last one too… Do you think elephants like karaoke?

72,73,8,4,"The twins were on the case. Christopher and Christina sat in their treehouse. They were going over the facts. Christina started pacing back and forth, thinking hard.

“So you put two socks into the dryer, but only one sock comes out,” she said.

Christopher nodded. “That’s right. But you never know for sure that one is missing until you sort them.”

“Right,” said Christina. “You go to make your pairs and wind up with one red sock and one blue sock at the end.”

“Right,” said Christopher. “So is the other blue sock turning red? Or is the other red sock turning blue? Or are two of the socks just disappearing altogether? It’s madness!” he shouted.

“It is madness,” Christina agreed. “People have been losing socks in the laundry since the beginning of time!” She thought about that. “Or at least since the sock was invented! It’s the biggest unsolved mystery in the history of the world!”

“Well we’re gonna solve it!” Christopher said, standing up too. “All we have to do is keep each other on our <i>toes</i> and put our best <i>foot</i> forward!” Christina rolled her eyes.

74,75,10,4,"Moira let her legs dangle off the wooden bench and started swinging them back and forth. Her toe accidentally kicked the wall of the bus shelter. It made a soft <i>thunk</i>. She did it again and added in the second foot. <i>Thunk thunk</i>. She began tapping them back and forth, building up a rhythm until she heard a small cough from beside her. 

The only other person at the bus stop was a man with a newspaper. He looked old, like her daddy, but not as old as Grandpa. He was wearing an expensive suit with dark striped pants. As Moira looked at him he gave her a stern look over his newspaper. He didn’t say anything but eventually turned the page and went back to his reading.

“What are you waiting for, Mister?” Moira asked him.

“I beg your pardon, young lady?” he replied.

“I’m just wondering what you’re waiting for,” she said. “It’s a real hot day to just be sitting around in the sun like this. Like, just for fun or something.” 

“This is a bus stop,” he said, keeping his eyes on his newspaper. “I am waiting for the bus.”

Moira stopped staring at him and started pulling at a loose thread on her dress. “It just looks to me like you might be some kind of rich, fancy type of business person or something. People like that don’t usually take the bus.”

The man folded his paper down and looked at her. “Young lady, did you know that it’s rude to ask how much money someone has?”

“I wasn’t asking!” Moira replied, trying to look shocked. “I just said what it <i>looks</i> like, and I think I’m right. Anyway, all I really meant was that you can wait for all kinds of stuff at a bus stop. Just because busses stop here doesn’t mean that nothing else does.”

The man considered this. “Yes, I suppose you’re right. What are you waiting for, then?” he asked.

“Well,” Moira said, standing up and shading her eyes with her hand, “I’m waiting for an adventure!”

75,76,7,4,"Ever since Eli was a little boy, he knew about the house at the end of the lane. “If you keep being naughty, you’re going to wind up in the house at the end of the lane,” his Oma would say, when he knocked over her paint pots. “Where did you come from - the house at the end of the lane?” his Opa would say, if Eli ran too fast and bumped into him. And once, late at night before Eli went back home from Oma and Opa’s house, his Oma said quietly, “Your mother went to the house at the end of the lane, you know. And she never came back.”

“That’s silly, Oma!” said Eli. “She’s picking me up tomorrow at the airport!”

“Of course, my pet,” said his Oma, and she hugged him tight and sent him to bed. The next day at the airport, Eli looked into his mother’s dark eyes, but everything seemed normal. His mother smiled her sharp-toothed smile and hugged him tight and took him home, and Eli forgot all about it.

The next summer when he was back at his Oma and Opa’s, it was a hot, boring day and Eli felt restless. He answered rudely when his Opa asked him a question, and shrugged when his Oma asked if he’d like to watch her paint. “What is this, the house at the end of the lane?” his Oma said. “I think you need to go play outside.” She pinched his cheek, so Eli knew she wasn’t really angry, but it just made him more annoyed. He slammed the door as he left, and scuffed his feet in the dirt behind the apartment building. When he looked up, he saw the house.

It was at the end of the lane, just like he’d been told. There were boards across the windows and the door creaked as he opened it. Inside, it was cool and dark and very quiet. There was a long hallway, with closed doors all along it. When Eli walked down it, his feet left footprints in the dust. At the end of the hallway was a tall mirror.

“I’m not afraid,” Eli said out loud. He reached a hand up and wiped the dust off the mirror. His reflection stared out at him. Then he saw a dark shape over his shoulder. Before he could turn around, he felt a strong push on his back, and he fell headfirst towards the mirror.

Eli scrambled to his feet. He was on the other side of the mirror, trapped in a tall box. Standing in the hallway looking in at him was his reflection - but something was different. Eli slapped his hand on the mirror, and his reflection didn’t move. He shouted, and his reflection smiled. It had dark eyes and pointy teeth. It turned and walked down the hallway, through the door and out into the light.

Gabe had to stretch his wobbly legs wide to get from one branch to the next. The squirrel climbed higher and higher. Gabe climbed higher and higher. Eventually, the squirrel reached a branch that was more like a twig. It was so skinny that it bent under the weight of the plump little squirrel. Gabe realized he would never be able to stand on that branch. The squirrel turned and looked down at Gabe. Gabe turned and looked down at the ground. He was higher up than he had realized.

79,80,8,4,"Ezra cornered Jasmine near the skipping ropes at recess. He was determined to find out who had been messing with the class goldfish, Mr. Pondscum. He wasn’t sure that Jasmine was the culprit, but something smelled fishy!

“Did you put blue food coloring in the goldfish bowl yesterday morning?” he asked.

“No,” Jasmine replied. “Why would I do something stupid like that?”

“I don’t know,” Ezra said, pacing back and forth in front of her. “Maybe because Mr. Pondscum saw you pick your nose that one time. Maybe because you didn’t get to name him ‘Sir Swimmy Fins’ like you wanted. Or maybe because you just don’t like fish.”

“You’re crazy,” Jasmine said. “I don’t care about that fish one way or the other. Him or his ugly name. As far as I’m concerned he is just another decoration in the classroom.”

“Then maybe you think the classroom could do with a bit more blue in it?” Ezra asked, leaning in close.

“No, that’s not what I mean. I mean that I don’t really like Mr. Pondscum that much, but I don’t want anything bad to happen to him either. I’m sure he’s very upset that he’s been turned all blue.” She paused. “It’s not a good color for him.” And with that Jasmine walked off into the playground. Ezra watched her go and knew he had to track down some more clues.

80,81,5,4,"In a very small village in a very small house, there once lived a young girl. The girl’s name was Abbatha, and she was also very small. Abbatha was so small that people often didn’t notice her. Sometimes she got stepped on in the market. Sometimes she got chased by kittens.

One evening Abbatha was standing on the windowsill, sweeping. Then, along came a wicked old man. All at once he plucked Abbatha from the windowsill, put her in his coat pocket, and hurried away. Abbatha screamed and yelled to be let out, but no one could hear her. Then she noticed a teeny tiny hole in the corner of the pocket. She held her breath and squeezed through. Just as she was about to swing down to the ground and run home, she had an idea. She was going to teach that wicked man a lesson.

Abbatha climbed back up the seams of the old man’s coat. She climbed up until she was standing right on top of the coat collar. Then she jumped up onto the brim of his hat. Abbatha was so light and small, that the old man had no idea what had happened. Then Abbatha leaned over the hat’s edge and whispered into his ear.

“This is the voice of your heart speaking,” she said. She tried to make her voice sound serious and impressive. “You have done a bad deed. You must pay for what you have done.”

The old man stopped in his tracks and turned around. “Who said that?” he cried.

“I don’t know about this, Zach,” Bradley said. “What if the old man never did anything? Then we’re just spying on him like creeps!”

“If you want to get out of here, that’s fine by me. I don’t think I can hold your big butt up much longer anyway.”

But just then Bradley did see something inside the house. A light began flickering up the wall like it was being reflected by a mirror. Bradley leaned in closer. He grabbed onto the windowsill with both arms and pressed his nose against the glass. The spot of light on the wall was growing bigger and bigger. It was turning from yellow to pink to green.

Just then the old man’s face appeared in the light! He was staring right at Bradley! Bradley screamed and Zach fell over. But Bradley was left hanging off the windowsill!

83,84,9,4,"This is an ancient Greek myth about an inventor named Daedalus (said like “ded-ah-luss”), and his son, Icarus (said like “ik-ah-russ): Daedalus and Icarus were trapped on an island. King Minos was angry at them and was holding them prisoner. But Daedalus was a very creative man. He spent all day thinking of ways to escape.

One day Daedalus looked up at some birds flying by and got an idea: wings! If they had wings, they could fly off the island! So Daedalus collected all the bird feathers he could find. Then he stuck the feathers together with wax to make wings. At last he strapped one pair of wings to Icarus, and one to himself. He told Icarus not to fly too close to the sun or else the wax would melt. Icarus agreed. So Daedalus and Icarus flapped their wings and flew into the sky!

They flew higher and higher! They were free at last! The water sparkled below them. The wind felt fresh on their faces. Icarus was having so much fun, he never wanted to stop! Daedalus warned Icarus to slow down. But Icarus didn’t listen. He kept flying higher and higher. But soon Icarus found himself too close to the sun! It was too hot! The wax began to melt! The feathers fell off! Icarus could feel himself falling. He tried to flap his arms but it was too late. Icarus fell back down into the sea with a loud SPLASH!

86,87,2,4,"Even when the rest of your body is asleep, your brain is still hard at work! That’s because your brain needs to get ready for the next day. While you sleep, your brain helps renew your whole body. It works to make your memory stronger. It also makes space to learn new things when you wake up! When you sleep, your brain is in one of two modes: “deep sleep” or “dreaming sleep.”

Most of the sleeping we do is in the deep sleep mode. We must go through the deep sleep mode before we get to dreaming sleep. When your brain is in deep sleep mode, your muscles are relaxed and your breathing is slow. This helps your whole body and brain recharge.

When we are in dreaming sleep mode, the brain becomes very active again. This is when your dreams happen! In dreaming sleep mode, your breathing and heart rate often speed up. Scientists are understanding more and more about how this part of sleep works. But, they still don’t understand <i>why</i> it happens! Why do we have dreams at all? It’s a mystery! Can you dream up an answer to that question?

The Greeks built a gigantic wooden horse. It was beautiful on the outside. But it was hollow on the inside. That’s because a bunch of sneaky Greek soldiers were hiding inside of it! The rest of the Greeks sent a message to Troy. They said they were ready to give up and stop fighting. They said they had a gift to share with the people of Troy as a sign of friendship. So the Greeks rolled their giant wooden horse up to the gates of Troy and left it there.

The Trojans came out to see their present. It looked like a pretty nice huge wooden horse to them. And the Greeks were nowhere to be seen! So the Trojans opened the gates and rolled the horse into the city. As the people of Troy slept that night, the Greek soldiers crept out of their hiding place. They climbed out of the horse and opened the gates of Troy from the inside! Soon all the other Greek soldiers joined them and they finally defeated the Trojans!

99,100,10,5,"Lulu Stucy was a pretty laid-back gal. She was curious and she loved to explore. Sometimes she’d get distracted by the call of a strange bird or the swirling pattern in a rock and completely forget where she was going. But she didn’t mind, and that’s why everybody called her Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy. It was also because Lulu had a habit of losing things.

“You’d lose your head if it wasn’t screwed on!” Grandma Lucy Stucy was fond of saying to her. And Lulu never used to mind losing things either, until one day she woke up and just didn’t want to be Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy anymore. She went downstairs and told her older brother Brucey all about it.

“OK,” Brucey Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “I hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

Lulu was wearing a skirt that day and didn’t have any pockets, so she just held the quarter tight in her hand. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to that weird dark stairwell behind the cafeteria, and back to the classroom. But as she was walking home at the end of the day, she looked in her hand and realized the quarter was gone!

“Oh no!” Lulu cried. “I must have put it down somewhere and forgot to pick it back up!”

But the next day her brother gave her a second chance. “OK,” Brucey Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “This time I <i>rinky</i>-<i>dinky</i>-hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

Lulu made sure to wear jeans with pockets that day, so she slipped the quarter into her pocket and forgot all about it. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to the big room with all the blue mats in it beside the gym, and back to the classroom. But as she was walking home at the end of the day, she looked in her pocket and realized the quarter was gone!

“Oh no!” Lulu cried. “There’s a hole in my pocket and I didn’t know! The quarter must have fallen right through!”

But the next day her brother gave her a third chance. “OK,” Brucy Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “This time I <i>winky</i>-<i>finky</i>-rinky-dinky-hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

This time Lulu wasn’t taking any chances. She opened her backpack and slipped the quarter into a pouch, inside a pocket, zipped up the whole thing and then buckled the flap. Feeling confident, she forgot all about it. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to the water fountain on the third floor that shot water up your nose, and back to the classroom. As Lulu was walking home along a stream, she noticed a feather on the ground of a kind she had never seen before. She took off her backpack to put the feather inside, but just then her hand slipped and the bag went tumbling down into the stream.

When Lulu got home she was so sad that she could barely hold her head up. “What’s the matter?” asked her brother, Brucey.

“I lost my backpack AND the quarter,” Lulu sniffed. “I’m gonna be Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy forever.”

Brucey looked at her. “You know, nobody is good at everything, but everybody has some things that they’re great at. We’re all good at different things and that’s what makes us, <i>us</i>! I don’t lose things very often, but I’m so clumsy that they should call me Brucey-Stucy-Drops-The- Juicy!” Lulu laughed. “And our baby sister sure is cute, but I’m about to start calling her Whoopsie-Poopsie-Baby-Stucy!” The baby giggled in her high-chair. “And Lulu, you might lose things a lot, but you also find things that nobody else sees. Look at that cool feather in your pocket! I’ve never seen one like it!”

Lulu went over and hugged her big brother. “Thanks, Brucey,” she said.

“No problem, sis,” he replied. “Besides, maybe there is a way to stop you from losing things all the time. We haven’t tried duct tape yet!”

The birthday girl, Ines, just stared up at the piñata, frowning. She knew what was supposed to happen on birthdays. After the cake, the party guests would gather below the piñata.

She loved candy, of course, but it didn’t seem fair to take it. That candy was part of the piñata, and he probably didn’t like being broken open for it! What had he ever done to them, anyway? So Ines made a plan.

When Ines’ mother put the birthday cake in front of her, she made a wish and blew out the candles. Then she looked up at the piñata. The piñata was still for a moment, and then it winked at her! Her wish had come true!

If Leah tried to open the snack cupboard, even if her mother was on a different floor of the house, she’d somehow know! “You have to save room for dinner!” she’d say, putting away the crackers. “No candy before bed!” she’d scold, as Leah was about to sneak a chocolate bar. “Marshmallows aren’t for eating, they’re for roasting!” she’d say, twisting up the bag and putting it out of reach.

One day, Leah accidentally left a cookie in her lunch box from school. She remembered it just as she was falling asleep. She sat up in bed and very, very quietly unzipped her backpack.

It took many weeks to sneak enough food, but finally Leah had it all hidden in her room. There was chocolate and candy and cookies and chips; there were even the forbidden marshmallows. Her mother said goodnight and turned off Leah’s light. Leah was so excited she could hardly wait. Very, very quietly, she laid out her feast on the bed. Very, very quietly she took her first bite.

“Leah!” The light flicked on. There stood her mother in the doorway!

110,111,7,5,"Nick dragged his feet all the way from the car to the ticket booth. “Why does THIS have to be our family tradition?” he whined. “The lamest holiday, and the lamest thing you can do for that holiday.” He kicked a hay bale as he passed, glared at a scarecrow, and pushed aside some corn stalks that had flopped over the path.

Unfortunately, his family was already too far ahead to hear him. They were practically running for the entrance, and he knew they all had big smiles on their faces. His two dads and his sister all loved the corn maze. In fact, by the time Nick got to the ticket booth, it seemed like they must have already gone in. Nick couldn’t even see them.

“Dad? Poppa?” he called. He hoped he didn’t look like a silly, lost little kid, but it was almost dark. They always did the maze together as a family! Why did they leave him behind?

“Looking for your parents and your sister, little boy?” said the person behind the ticket booth. It was someone dressed up as a witch, but to Nick it seemed like it was a more realistic costume than the people at the corn maze usually had. Their voice was creaky, and their green, pointy nose came close as the they leaned across the counter. Nick took a step back.

“They just went in - they said for you to follow,” the witch cackled, pointing into the maze.

Nick hurried in. He was sure he’d find his family just around the corner, waiting for him. But as soon as he got under the entrance arch, which said “Enter At Your Own Risk,” everything became quiet. He couldn’t hear the cars or the crowd at the food trucks, and most of all, he couldn’t hear his family. Fog closed in around his ankles. He couldn’t see through the corn walls at all. Nick shoved his hands in his pockets and pulled his hood up. He walked quickly down the path, taking turn after turn, hay crunching under his feet. Then he stopped.

There was someone following him.

Luis was feeling <i>so</i> good and enjoying his ice cream <i>so</i> much that he didn’t see the tree root sticking out near his feet. His friends tried to warn him, but it was too late. Luis’ foot got caught in the root and the ice cream slipped out of his hand! That perfect chocolate-vanilla swirl flew through the air like it was in slow-motion. It spun end over end in a big arc and all the kids watched it, holding their breath. As it was coming back down towards the ground, Luis’ friend Ayesha ran forward to catch it. She stretched out her arm, opened her hand, and grabbed it! 

So what if she didn’t catch it cone-end first? A handful of ice cream is much better than no ice cream at all!

It made him want to sneeze. He was just turning to head back downstairs when he noticed something about a large dresser beside him. It was made of a dark wood and came up almost as high as his chest. It was also covered in dust, except for in one place. Right on top there was a clear rectangle where no dust had settled at all. 

“Something really <i>has</i> been taken from here,” Norris whispered to the empty room. “But what was it? And why is it gone?”

116,117,7,5,"Jeremy’s eyes snapped open. He lay very still in his sleeping bag, staring at the living room ceiling. What had woken him up? He listened very hard. He couldn’t hear any noises, but something seemed weird. He listened for another few seconds, but he was sleepy from staying up with his friends. They always talked late into the night when they had a sleepover. Slowly, Jeremy let his eyes close.

His friends - that was it! Jeremy’s eyes flew open again and he sat straight up in in his sleeping bag on the floor. He hadn’t woken up because of a noise - he’d woken up because of silence! Where was Matt’s snoring? And the weird whistling sound Jesse made when he was sleeping? Maybe they had both gone to the bathroom. But no - Jeremy looked over at their sleeping bags, and saw that there were definitely bodies in both of them. Bodies that seemed to be lying very, very still.

“Guys?” Jeremy said in a small whisper. Matt and Jesse’s sleeping bags didn’t move. Even though he knew he was probably imagining things, Jeremy wiggled out of his sleeping bag and crawled across to Matt, who was nearest him. It was dark, but from the grey glow of the streetlights through the curtains, it looked like Matt was lying on his front, facing away from him. The carpet was scratchy on his hands and knees. He tapped Matt’s shoulder. “Matt?”

There was no answer. Jeremy felt silly, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Kneeling beside Matt, he took both hands and carefully turned him over.

But the thing he turned over wasn’t Matt.

117,118,12,5,"When Iguana was just a little lizard, Iguana Mama told him all about what made iguanas special. She told him that iguanas were reptiles, and that they had spikes and scales, and that they were cold-blooded.

“Cold-blooded” made Iguana think of a cold, hard heart made of ice, and of tough guys wearing leather jackets and sunglasses. So, Iguana found a spot by himself on the branch of a tree and sat there in the shade, wearing his shades.

Awhile later, a monkey came along and saw Iguana sitting on his branch alone. “Hey there, Iguana!” he said. “You look a little lonely on that branch by yourself. I was just on my way to meet some friends at Sunny Rock to do some monkeying around, wanna come hang?”

“No,” Iguana replied. “I am one cold-blooded iguana. I have hard scales and big spikes. I’m tough, I’m mean, and my heart is made of ice! I don’t feel nothin’ and I don’t need nobody!”

So, off the monkey went to Sunny Rock without him.

Awhile later, a parrot came along and saw Iguana sitting on the branch alone. “Hey there, Iguana!” she said. “You look like you could use someone to talk to. I was just on my way to meet some friends at Sunny Rock and have a chat, wanna come ruffle some feathers?”

“No,” Iguana replied. “I am one cold-blooded iguana. I have hard scales and big spikes. I’m tough, I’m mean, and my heart is made of ice! I don’t feel nothin’ and I don’t need nobody!”

So, off the parrot went to Sunny Rock without him.

Awhile later, a jaguar came along and saw Iguana sitting on his branch alone. “Hey there, Iguana!” he said. “It looks like the sun is about to go behind those clouds. It might be cold here in the shade. I was just about to go stretch out and get nice and warm at Sunny Rock, wanna come take a cozy cat-nap?”

“No,” Iguana replied. “I am one cold-blooded iguana. I have hard scales and big spikes. I’m tough, I’m mean, and my heart is made of ice! I don’t feel nothin’ and I don’t need nobody!”

So, off the jaguar went to Sunny Rock without him.

Just then the sun did go behind the clouds, and Iguana’s spot became darker and shadier than ever. Behind his shades, Iguana could hardly see anything at all! Without the heat of the sun, Iguana became colder and colder until he was shivering up on his branch. 

Suddenly, Iguana heard the familiar voice of Iguana Mama calling to him. “Iguana, what are you doing up there on that cold, dark branch all alone? You’re going to freeze!”

“But, Mama,” Iguana replied, “I’m a cold-blooded iguana, just like you said! I have hard scales and big spikes. I’m tough, I’m mean, and my heart is made of ice! I don’t feel nothin’ and I don’t need nobody!”

“Oh, Iguana,” sighed Iguana Mama, “being cold-blooded doesn’t mean your heart is made of ice, and it doesn’t mean you can’t feel! In fact, it actually means you feel everything EXTRA intensely! Your body is SO sensitive that if you sit somewhere hot, your whole body gets hot, and if you sit somewhere cold, your whole body gets cold!”

“But what about my spikes?” Iguana asked. “And what about my scales?” 

“Sometimes the critters that look toughest on the outside are really the ones that are most sensitive on the inside,” said Iguana Mama. 

Iguana agreed, and the two of them went straight to Sunny Rock to warm up with all their friends. On Sunny Rock it was bright and warm, and even though he didn’t feel so cold-blooded anymore, Iguana left his sunglasses on. 
"
118,119,10,5,"They had come too far to turn back now. Aidan stood at the top of the tall hill and looked down into the park below. Everything was covered in a thick layer of icy snow. The kids playing in their bright snowsuits at the bottom looked like little wriggling gummy bears from so high up. Some were playing tag, some were hurling ice chunks at each other, and one kid seemed to have gotten his head stuck in a snow drift so that only his little kicking legs were sticking out. Aidan could see them all. It had not been easy to get here, but they were finally ready to do what they had come to do: go sledding down the biggest hill in town.

They had overcome many hurdles to reach the top of that hill. Earlier that day when his friends Tara and Jack had arrived at Aidan’s house, the idea was already brewing in his mind. 

“What should we do today?” Tara asked, sitting cross-legged and chewing on a strand of her hair. “It’s so grey outside that I forget what the sun looks like. Do you think we’ll ever wear shorts again? I miss having a sunburn, is that normal?” She flopped backwards onto the carpet.

“I don’t know,” Jack sighed. “We could play ‘Aidan’s-Dirty-Sock-Torture-Chamber’: we all get locked in Aidan’s closet and the last one to faint from the stench wins.” 

“No,” Aidan said, grinning at the others. “We’re going to make history! We’re going to have an adventure! We’re going to conquer The Bowel-Bunching Bluff, The Reckless Ridge, The Crazy-Man’s Cliff– we’re going to sled down the Cedarvale Hill!”

Tara and Jack both stared at him. The hair even fell out of Tara’s mouth. Then, slowly, they both began to smile as well, an excited look on each face.

“Yes!” Jack cried, punching the air. “We’re going to sled down the Cedarvale Hill! We’re gonna do it! Let’s go right now! Let’s–”

That’s when the first of their troubles appeared, and it sounded like Aidan’s mom. “Oh no you’re not.” She called matter-of-factly from some distant room in the house. “That Cedarvale Hill is way too dangerous! No way you kids are sliding down that death trap!”

“But, Mom!” Aidan yelled back at the ceiling in the general direction of his mother’s voice. “All we’re gonna do is–”

“Nope!” the voice interrupted him, this time seeming to come from the hall on their left. “It’s too icy out anyway. The snow won’t even be good for sledding! It’ll be one big ice slope, like with those koo-koo crazy people at the Olympics, those skeleton people with the death wish. No way.”

“But, MOM!” Aidan cried.

“Butts are for sitting, Aidan, honey,” replied the voice, now mysteriously echoing from the kitchen on their right. 

“I guess maybe your mom’s right,” Jack said quietly. “It is super icy out there today. The whole park will be like a big lumpy skating rink.”

“I’m always right, Jack! Just like <i>your</i> mother! And smart children listen to us!” the voice replied. They heard a door close.

“How did she even hear that?” Tara whispered.

“I hear everything,” said the voice of Aidan’s mom. “So, don’t you kids get up to any trouble.”

Looking annoyed but determined, Aidan silently signalled to the others that they should go down to the cellar. Once they were down there, they used a scrap piece of paper to write and draw back and forth until they came up with a plan: they would build a giant blanket fort in the living room and bring the family laptop inside. Then, they would start a movie playing and crank the volume way up, so that if Aidan’s mom came by, she would just think they were sitting around in there watching it. Then they would sneak out of the house through the cellar door, slide down the hill a few times, set some world records for amazing bravery, and sneak back into the house before the movie was over without anyone being the wiser! It was brilliant.

<i>Sounds like a plan! </i>Tara wrote. <i>Where do you keep your sled?</i>

And that’s when Aidan realized the big problem at the core of his brilliant scheme: he didn’t have a stupid sled! As if she could read Aidan’s mind, Tara smacked her forehead with the palm of her hand. 

But, not ready to give up just yet, Aidan held up a finger to tell them to wait. He started poking in a cupboard in a corner of the room and returned a moment later with three black plastic garbage bags in his hand. The other two looked stunned. Jack began shaking his head forcefully. Aidan began nodding, the grin back on his face. Tara rolled her eyes. They put the plan in motion.

Once the fort was built and the movie was playing, Tara, Jack, and Aidan crept quietly back down to the cellar. They had listened for a while to hear if Aidan’s mom was onto them, but she seemed to have gone quiet. They hurried to slip on their boots and coats without making any noise. As they were about to leave, Jack began trying to signal something to both of them. He was wiggling his arms around energetically and pointing, his face going red with the effort. Aidan looked at Tara and she shrugged. Neither of them had any idea what Jack was trying to say. Jack gave up and found another piece of scrap paper:

<i>If we are going down the biggest hill in town on nothing more than a square of plastic, </i>he wrote, <i>then I think we might want some kind of body armour. Trash bags don’t steer so well.</i>

Five minutes later each one of them was wearing at least three layers of puffy winter jackets, and Jack even had an old hockey helmet on for good measure. They were finally ready.

 

When they reached the top of the hill Aidan looked down at all the tiny people and trees so far below them. For the first time he realized just how high up they were. He felt the bottoms of his feet go sweaty and had to swallow a lump in his throat. Tara was also looking down the slope of the hill, but the glint in her eye made Aidan think that she wasn’t having any second thoughts at all. Jack was sitting on his garbage bag, with his back to the view. He was struggling to put his mitten back on, which was hard to do through three layers of puffy jacket: the material around his arms was so thick that he could barely reach one hand to the other. He looked like an extremely fat baby. An extremely fat baby who plays hockey.

Aidan walked over to help Jack, careful not to slip on the slick ice. Just as he knelt down to help, Jack finally tugged the mitten on and punched the air with satisfaction. But the quick motion was too much, and Jack began slowly sliding backwards on his bag over the crest of the hill! Aidan reached out a hand but it was too late, he could just see Jack’s surprised face disappearing down the slope at top speed!

Aidan and Tara watched Jack all the way down the steep, icy hill. It turned out that Jack was right after all: trash bags don’t steer so well.

119,120,10,5,"Keisha fought her way down the street through the howling wind. She kept her head bent against the pouring rain. The drawstring on the hood of her raincoat was pulled tight into a scrunchy circle around her face. Small rivers streamed over her shiny red rain boots up to the ankle. <i>There must be more water inside them than outside them at this point</i>, she thought. Below the hem of her jacket, her jeans felt heavy and suffocating. But, as she walked she felt the crisp, dry edges of the folded paper inside the waistband of her pants, and she relaxed. The letter was still dry. As long as she got out of the rain soon, there was still a chance.

She saw the entrance to the subway a block ahead of her on the left. She started to walk a bit faster. On her right she passed an old movie theatre. A large crowd of people were huddled underneath its awning staring out at her. They were silent and looked terrified to let the water touch them. Keisha waved at them, but nobody waved back. She kept walking. Two grey mice floated past her, bobbing along the street in a plastic take-out container. Finally, she reached the subway entrance.

The heavy door was in the middle of a deep puddle. Keisha had to push hard to get it to open. As the door swung open, she saw the water from the puddle go swooshing down the stairs to the platform. The wind held the door open and more water came flooding in. The stairs were now an outright waterfall, with Keisha standing boldly at its top.

120,121,8,5,"All day Elliot had been busy baking double-decker-chunky-chocolate-fudge cookies. On Monday he was going to sell them out of his locker at school for 50 cents a pop, and he was going to be rich! But all day cookies had been disappearing almost as quickly as he could bake them! Elliot questioned his brother, Jeremy, who was always jealous of Elliot’s million-dollar ideas. 

“Have you been eating all my cookies?” Elliot asked.

“Gross!” Jeremy said. “I don’t even like double-decker-chunky-chocolate-fudge cookies. I would rather eat a frog than one of those! In fact, I keep a nice slimy frog right here under my pillow. Wanna see?” Elliot moved on to his next suspect.

Elliot questioned his dad, who was overly sensitive about the kitchen ceiling getting splattered with chocolate. 

“Have you been eating all my cookies?” Elliot asked.

“No.” his dad said. “But I hope that you’ve been cleaning up as you go and that you haven’t left cookie batter everywh–” Elliot moved on to his next suspect.

Elliot had questioned his mom, who had been gardening in the backyard all day. 

“Have you been eating all my cookies?” Elliot asked.

“Of course not!” his mom said. “I’ve been working in my flower bed all day. Look, you can see the dirt all over my gardening gloves!”

Elliot didn’t know what to think. He was just about ready to give up when he saw his dog Puff sniffing at something in the hall. He went over to see what it was: a trail of cookie crumbs! Dark brown crumbly bits all in a line leading down the hall to the basement. 

“That’s good detective work, Puff! Whoever has been stealing my cookies must be down there! It looks like we’re going to solve the Mystery of the Missing Cookies once and for all!”

So, Elliot and Puff crept down the stairs into the dark basement. Elliot held onto the railing with both hands. He was careful to avoid the middle of each step so it wouldn’t creak. Puff padded down the stairs on all fours and wagged her tail excitedly. When they reached the bottom Elliot could see somebody hunched in the corner but couldn’t tell who it was. He flicked on the light switch and gasped! His very own sweet mother was standing there with chocolate smeared all over her face! Dark brown crumbs coated the fingers of her flowery gardening gloves.

She looked up at him, surprised. “Yes! Yes! It was me all along! I stole the cookies and I’d do it again! Chocolate is my weakness but I won’t apologize! Lock me up if you have to but just don’t take away my cookies!”

“Hey detective,” it said. “I know something about this case that you don’t.” The voice was rough and low.

132,133,9,5,"There is an ancient Greek myth about a young girl named Arachne (said like “ah-rak-nay”), and the goddess Athena. The myth says that Arachne was very very good at weaving. All day Arachne would spin thread into yarn with a spindle. Then all night Arachne would use a loom to weave beautiful fabrics. Arachne got so good at weaving that she began to brag about her talent. She said that nobody in the whole world could weave as well as she did– not even a god. 

This angered the goddess Athena. Athena was the Greek goddess of wisdom and crafts. She did not like to hear a human claiming to be more skillful than a goddess. So, Athena challenged Arachne to a contest. They would both create a weaving. Whoever created the best weaving would win. Whoever lost would never be allowed to use a spindle or loom again! Arachne agreed and they both began weaving.

Arachne created a beautiful fabric. She used threads of every colour. It was as soft as silk and as strong as rock. But when it was Athena’s turn, she created something incredible. Athena did not use thread to weave. Instead, she used the morning sunbeams and the fluffy white clouds. She used the green of spring fields and the blue of the sky. Of course, Athena won the contest. Arachne was very upset. She would never be allowed to weave again! 

But Athena took pity on Arachne… by turning her into a spider! That way, Arachne wouldn’t need a spindle or loom. She could still spin and weave all day as she made her webs! And that’s why we call spiders “arachnids”– all because of the ancient Greek story of Arachne!

133,134,3,5,"In ancient times, there was a story about how the city of Rome was created. Most people now believe that the story was a myth. But, many ancient Romans believed that it really happened. 

The story tells of a pair of twin brothers: Remus and Romulus. The twins were the sons of King Amulius. King Amulius was the king of Alba Longa (a city near to where Rome would be). But he was afraid that his sons would try to steal his throne some day. So King Amulius threw Remus and Romulus into the river Tiber! Luckily, the twins were saved by Tiberinus, the god of the river. Tiberinus left the twins safely in a cave.

In the cave was a female wolf. But instead of attacking the children, the wolf cared for them as her own. Remus and Romulus drank the wolf’s milk. The wolf protected them as they learned and grew. When they were grown, Remus and Romulus set out to start their own city. Romulus chose the hill on which the city would stand. The city was named “Rome” in his honor. Thousands of years later, the wolf that raised Remus and Romulus is still seen as a symbol of the city. The wolf cared for the human children and gave them everything they needed– just like Rome.

Delilah was looking out at the row of blueish mountains that stretched far into the distance. Skorin was looking at his shoes and tugging little blades of grass out of the ground.

“I don’t know,” Skorin replied thoughtfully. “How can you know if they’re real or not when they’re invisible?”

“Angels aren’t supposed to be invisible all the time,” Delilah said. “My grandma used to say she saw an angel outside of her window on the night I was born. She said it was flying through the sky and covering the moon.”

Just then everything seemed to get suddenly darker.  He looked at Delilah who was looking back at him with confusion on her face. The shadow stretched wide all around them and seemed to swallow the entire hill! They looked up.

It was a deep purple color and had a long spiraling horn coming out of the front. Skorin could see one humongous glassy round eye staring out from the side of its head, but he didn’t know if the thing could see him or not. It was so big that it was covering up the sun! Delilah pointed to the left to show dozens more of the creatures making their slow way across the sky behind the first. 

“Angels! A whole flock of real live angels!” Delilah yelled.

“No!” said Skorin. “They’re not angels, they’re narwhallas!”

Have you ever thought about how much space there is up there? Sure, Mariam has to avoid the lamps, and step over the door frames. But soon she figured out she could bring her toys up with her by walking up and down the walls - and her mother never looks up so she never sees the mess! No more putting toys away for Mariam!

She raised her hand to ask Mrs.Crenlaw if she could go, but when she opened her mouth all she could say was “Can I... bathroom? I’m gonna–” She burped loudly and shut her mouth tight again to stop anything else from coming out. Forgetting about permission, Esme jumped up and ran for the door. Sprinting towards the girls’ bathroom, she kept one hand covering her mouth just in case. As she reached the door and shoved it open she thought: <i>Why does every word for throwing up make it sound like you’re actually throwing up when you say it?</i> <i>Hurl, barf, vomit, spew…</i>

Before she could answer herself she felt a terrible gurgling from her stomach. She wrenched open one of the stall doors and stepped inside. She stared down into the toilet water and tried to take a deep breath. <i>Gross!</i> She thought. <i>I knew I should have never let Georgia talk me into that stupid gummy worm eating contest. But Georgia can’t be feeling too great either, she must have eaten twice as many as me!</i>

Just then there was the creak of the bathroom door opening and a slam from the stall door on Esme’s right. Esme heard a small burp and bent lower to see the shoes in the next stall. Just as she thought, she saw a pair of bright blue sneakers with red racing stripes. 

“Hey Georgia,” Esme said. “At least we’re in this togeth–” But Esme wasn’t sure that Georgia heard the rest of it over the wet splash from the next stall.

Up on top of the roof next door, two round glowing circles stood out against the darkness. Priya realized they were not stars, they were eyes. But it was too dark to see what creature the eyes belonged to. Whatever it was started to growl. Suddenly she was picturing the monsters of every campfire story she had ever heard. She imagined curved horns, and sharp teeth and long, powerful, scaly tails. Then a second pair of eyes appeared, right beside the first. These eyes were smaller, but also glowing. Then a third pair appeared beside those!

176,177,2,6,"Did you know that the amount of water there is in the world never EVER changes? Not even by a drop, it’s true! Since the very beginning of our planet way, way, way, way, way, WAAAAY back a long time ago, we’ve had the exact same amount of water on Earth. And it has been the SAME water this whole time, just popping up in different forms! That means that the water you drink from the fountain at school could be the same water that ran through the Nile River in ancient Egypt! How is that possible, you ask? It’s all through the amazing science of the “Water Cycle”. Want to find out how it works? WATER you waiting for? Read on!

The first step in the Water Cycle is “evaporation”. Evaporation is what happens when the sun gets so hot that it heats up water all over the planet, and changes it from a liquid into steam or vapour that rises up into the air. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, rivers, ponds, puddles– even off of your own skin when you sweat! So if all that water is constantly evaporating, where does it all go? Good question!

The next step in the Water Cycle is “condensation”. Condensation is what happens when all of that steam and water vapour get together in the air and start to cool down again. When that happens, the water vapour turns back into its liquid form and becomes clouds in the sky! Have you ever seen a cloud that looked like a dragon? Or a dog? Or your Uncle Ernie with the ear hair? Well, it turns out they were all just water vapour the whole time! (Except your real Uncle Ernie, he’s a person). So now all that water is hanging out as a bunch of clouds, but how does it get back down to Earth?

RAIN! And snow! And sleet! And hail! The next step in the Water Cycle is “precipitation”, and precipitation is anything formed in clouds that falls back to Earth. Precipitation happens when so much of that water vapour gets together in one place that it becomes too heavy to keep in the clouds. Rain is water vapour falling back to Earth in its liquid form, whereas snow, hail, and sleet are all water vapour dressed up in some of its solid forms! What’s your favourite kind of precipitation? Rain is more refreshing than snow, but it’s really hard to make a rain-angel. So, is that it? Is that the final step in the cycle?

Nope– but almost! The very final step in the Water Cycle is “collection”. Collection is everything that happens to the precipitation when it actually lands back on the surface of our planet. Some precipitation falls right back into lakes and oceans and, easy-peasy, it’s ready for evaporation again. But some precipitation falls on land, and then it is collected in one of two ways: either it’s absorbed <i>into</i> the ground and becomes the water that plants drink, or it runs <i>over</i> the ground in rivers and streams until it reaches an ocean or lake once again!

So that’s it, the whole kit-and-kaboodle of the Water Cycle! It just keeps going around and around and around and around and– ok I’ll stop, I’m making myself dizzy! Now go get quenched!

181,182,4,6,"Ko stood in Selwyn the Sorcerer’s small, cramped study. If you had asked her what she was doing, she would have told you that she was dusting a collection of rare magical gadgets which stood upon a low end-table. And she would have believed that that’s what she was doing. However, what she was <i>actually</i> doing was swiping distractedly at those gadgets with a large, poofy feather duster, not noticing that she had knocked several of them to the floor. She hadn’t noticed because her eyes were fixed on something across the room: the key.

Since Ko had left the Tuskin Forest to work for Selwyn, she had been intensely interested in that key. It was long and thin, with a round loop at the top, and a complicated little rectangular piece at the bottom. Its tiny markings looked ancient, but its golden shine made it seem newly crafted. The key sat on a small, deep blue pillow inside a rectangular glass case.  The glass case sat right in the center of Selwyn’s large wooden desk. 

Ko was truly a forest creature, and many things in her new life seemed strange to her. First of all, she was very small. The top of her tufted head barely reached higher than Selwyn’s knees. She often had to climb the many tall bookshelves to reach items at the top (more than a few glass vials had been broken this way). She was covered all over in thick, soft, bright orange fur. She found that it did not camouflage her well in this place, the way that it had when she lived in the boubadrill trees. Being unable to blend-in with the grey stones and dark wood of the sorcerer’s tower had only caused problems because of one thing: Ko was extremely curious. Her one large, round eye would often catch a flicker or glimpse of something mysterious, and she just could not resist going after it. Selwyn did not like Ko to do this, though he understood that there are many interesting and mysterious things in the home of a sorcerer.

So there Ko was, staring at the key and wondering what it was for. She thought it must be connected to the one part of the tower she was never supposed to go: the Hall of Entries. <i>But what could be hidden there? Why aren’t I allowed to see it? What purpose does the Hall have if it is always kept locked?</i> Ko found herself stepping closer to the desk. The feather duster had fallen out of her hand. <i>If the key was so important, why did Selwyn just leave it there on his desk? If doors were meant to stay locked, why was the key so easy to find?</i> Ko was standing right up against the carved desk. A reflection of the golden key shimmered in Ko’s single huge eye. <i>If I took just the tiniest of peaks, what could really go wrong? </i>Before she knew it, Ko had opened the glass box, grabbed the key, and darted from the room.

She ran down the stone staircase that sprialled around the inside of the tower walls. The key felt strangely heavy for its size. Ko could feel it tingling in her hand. She jumped from step to step until she reached a tall painted archway that marked the Hall of Entries. It was blocked off by a thick, red velvet rope tied on either side. Through the archway, Ko could see a long, long hallway lined with doors on either side. It extended so far that Ko could not see the end of it. Ko stepped under the velvet rope. She didn’t even have to duck.

Once she was inside, everything seemed very hushed. Ko looked up and saw a colourful stained-glass ceiling curving high above her. <i>THWACK!</i> A loud sound erupted from her right. She spun around and saw a small, pale wooden doorway, not much bigger than she was. An uneven pounding was coming from that door as if something angry was trying to escape from it. Ko noticed a rusted metal lock on its face. She looked down at the key in her hand and gulped. Slowly, she crept towards the door and tried the key in the lock. It didn’t fit. Ko breathed a deep sigh of relief. Backing away from the small pounding door, Ko continued down the hall. She tried the key in each door as she went. 

No matter how far she walked, it seemed to Ko that no two doors in the hall were alike. Some were so large that Ko could not even reach their locks, while others were so small Ko was sure they couldn’t possibly hold more than an idea inside. Some of the doors were square, or round, or farfingle-shaped and some seemed to change shape the longer Ko looked at them. Ko didn’t hear pounding coming from any other doors, but there were other strange sounds– and smells. One door was made out of chunks of glowing pink crystal and smelled strongly of salty sea water. Another was just a simple rectangle carved into the stone wall and covered in dust, but Ko heard the twitterings of a thousand birds just behind it. One particularly odd door was a thin mesh covering a shadowy tunnel. Ko couldn’t see what was inside, but there was a creepy high-pitched whine coming from it, and the whole thing smelled of rotten eggs. Ko tried door after door after door, but none of the locks fit the key. Until finally, Ko came to a door and just knew it must be the right one.

The door was large and circular. It was made of the same shining gold as the key and had the same strange markings carved into its face. Ko took a deep breath and put the key into the lock. The key glowed for a moment and became warm in her hand. Then the door opened.

The door swung slowly open and Ko’s fanged mouth dropped open as she saw what lay beyond. Behind the doorway, a hall extended so far that she could not see the end of it. The hall had high, curved ceilings and was lined with doors on either side.

186,187,4,6,"You are walking through the Dreamscape. The clouds feel soft on your bare feet. With every step, tiny white wisps spurt up between your toes. You come upon an old abandoned dwell. There are no reveries here to buzz, bubble, squeak, or yell. Everything is quiet. You look around.

As you explore the dwell, you see evidence of all the dreams that have passed through here before: bits of colorful confetti from a Poppa Pinata or two, some old frosting from a floating eggoon, a wobbly Vorp Fort about to collapse. You notice a miraj storage and an imaginanium tank. You look inside only to find that they are both empty.

187,188,3,6,"An emu (said like “ee-moo”), is a type of large bird that is only found in Australia. Emus have big round eyes, long necks, and cannot fly. Emus look a lot like their relative, the ostrich! Emus are very common in Australia, like huge, long-legged pigeons! In some parts of Australia, there are so many emus that they cause problems for the people who live there. Just like in the Great Emu War of 1932!

In 1932, more and more people in Western Australia were becoming farmers. These farmers mostly grew wheat. Since there were so many new farmers, some of them started farming on land that nobody had used before. When 20 000 emus came strutting back from their migration season and settled there, they realized why! Emus were all over the place! The emus liked to eat the farmers’ crops and make holes in their fences. There were so many emus that the farmers couldn’t stop them. The farmers had to ask the government for help. 

When the government saw what was going on, they sent in the military! Those emus caused so much trouble that the Australian government went to war with them! The military sent in soldiers with guns and trucks to try and get the emus off of the farmland. But the emus were too fast and too smart for the soldiers. The emus ran in small groups which made them hard to chase. The emus also started warning each other when they saw the soldiers coming. After a while, the military gave up and left. And that’s the way those big, beautiful birds won the Great Emu War of 1932!

Odin, the eldest and wisest of the Gods, also heard about the potion and set out on a quest to collect some from the Giants. He wanted to give the Magic Mead to humankind so that their words would become wise and beautiful. First, Odin disguised himself as a poor wanderer and went to the farm of Baugi, the brother of Suttung the Giant. Odin, in his disguise, offered to work Baugi’s fields in exchange for a reward. Baugi replied that it takes nine men to work his fields, and could not be done by one man alone. Odin promised he could do it, if he would be rewarded. Baugi agreed.

Using his great power and wisdom, Odin did the work of nine men in one night. The next day Baugi was pleased, and asked what the wanderer wanted as a reward. Odin replied that he wanted a drink of the Magic Mead kept by Baugi’s brother, Suttung. Baugi went to Suttung to ask for the Magic Mead, but Suttung refused.

""You cannot give away the Magic Mead!” Suttung said to Baugi. ""It is too valuable! I have trapped my daughter in a cave just to protect it! Besides, that poor wanderer seems too powerful to be who he says he is, I do not trust him.”

Baugi returned to Odin and told him that Suttung would not let him have any of the Magic Mead. Odin reminded Baugi that he owed him a reward for his work, and so Baugi must help him enter the cave and get the Magic Mead in secret. Baugi agreed and led him to the cave where the Mead was hidden.

The entrance to the cave was blocked by stones, but Baugi used his Giants’ strength to make a small hole in the rock. Suddenly, Odin transformed himself into a snake and slipped through the hole. Baugi realized he had been tricked by the poor wanderer, but it was too late.

Inside the cave Odin heard Gunnlod, Suttung’s daughter, expressing how much she wanted to be free. ""I wish I could leave this cave,” she cried, ""but the spell my father cast on me has forced me to stay here with the Magic Mead forever!”

Odin changed back into his real form and slowly approached Gunnlod. ""If you give me the Magic Mead, I will use my great powers to lift the spell your father cast and free you from this cave!” Hesitantly, Gunnlod agreed and Odin lifted the spell. Then Odin used his wisdom to lead them both out of the cave safely. Once they reached the bright world outside, Odin gave Gunnlod a sip of the Magic Mead, and they parted ways as friends. Gunnlod sang wise and beautiful words about Odin for the rest of her life.

They believed that bees were a symbol of a bee-god named Ah-Muzen-Cab. Because of this, the bees were loved, honoured and respected. Whole bee hives were kept inside of people’s houses! Families collected the honey and took care of the bees. Most bee hives were passed down from one generation to the next, and some even lasted up to 80 years! There are not many stingless bees left in the world, but some people still practice this ancient form of beekeeping today!

200,201,3,6,"In Europe during the Middle Ages (between the 5th and 15th centuries), people had many laws that we find strange today. One of those laws meant that you could take animals to court! During that period, people would sometimes take legal action against animals for harming their property. Have mice been stealing from your harvest? Take them to the judge! Have bugs been eating your crops? Let a jury decide! Historians say that even back then, people knew that the animals weren’t <i>really</i> criminals. Instead, people charged these animals with crimes in court so they would be allowed to get rid of them. If those mice were found guilty of stealing, it was okay for the farmer to chase them out of his fields. So, what do you think the judge said when a skunk was on trial? ""Odor in the court!”

So, it wasn’t totally surprising when he kept a bear as a pet in his Cambridge University dorm room! When Byron arrived at university, he found out that dogs were not allowed. To protest this (and make a joke), Byron went out and bought a tame bear. He brought the bear to university with him and kept it in his dorm room. When Cambridge staff tried to stop him, Byron pointed out that there was no actual university rule against bears. Eventually the university had to agree that he was right and let him keep the bear. After that Byron often took his bear for walks around the campus on a leash. He even suggested once that he would enroll the bear in classes! Byron loved animals of all kinds and had many pets during his life. Besides the bear, he also had cats, dogs, horses, a fox, monkeys, an eagle, a crow, a falcon, peacocks, geese, a badger, a heron, and a goat!

British dogs were also eager to do their part. Dogs were trained to spot far-off enemies and send messages from base to base. Soldiers slipped notes into tubes on their collars and the dogs ran back and forth delivering them. The dogs were fast and difficult to catch. Plus, they chased the rats out of the trenches!

Pigeons helped to send messages over even longer distances! They were trained to fly from Britain to the battlefields and back again. This allowed news to travel quickly both ways. The pigeons were so good at this job that the Germans even trained hawks to attack them in flight!

Millions of furry and feathered friends were also heroes of WW1!

209,210,5,6,"Every year on Ibrahim’s birthday, Uncle Ali would bake him a super scrumptious special strawberry shortcake. The shortcake was so sensationally special because every year Uncle Ali baked it to be the exact same height as Ibrahim! The cake would have layers and layers of biscuit, whipped cream, and strawberries piled up to the very tip top of the birthday boy’s head!

When Ibrahim was just a little tiny baby, the shortcake was only two layers tall. Ibrahim’s mother sat him down on the counter beside the cake and Ibrahim tried to give it a hug.

A few birthdays later, Ibrahim had grown up to six years old and the shortcake had grown up to three and a half feet tall! Uncle Ali had to bake seven whole layers and hung a sign on it that said ""Must be this tall to ride”.

A few birthdays after that, Ibrahim was twelve years old and the shortcake was five whole feet tall! Uncle Ali had to buy all the strawberries in the market, and he had to stand on a chair to put the last ones on top.

But then Ibrahim really hit his growth spurt. He grew to six feet tall, and then to seven, and then to eight feet tall and there was no sign of him slowing down!

By the time Ibrahim turned sixteen, he was thirty feet tall! Ibrahim was taller than his mom and his dad and the oak tree in their yard. He was so tall that he couldn’t fit inside the house anymore! Instead, he lived in a big blue tent under the highway and waved to people in their cars on their way to work.

But Uncle Ali was still determined to make Ibrahim his special birthday strawberry shortcake. Uncle Ali went to every supermarket in town and bought every last strawberry they had. He spent three days mixing the batter and getting ready. And then he started to bake.

Uncle Ali baked layer upon layer of cake. He stacked them up as they came out of the oven: biscuit, whipped cream, strawberries, biscuit, whipped cream, strawberries. Uncle Ali stood on a chair and kept stacking. Uncle Ali stood on the table and kept stacking. Uncle Ali climbed up a ladder and kept stacking. Uncle Ali climbed onto the roof and kept stacking. But he just couldn’t get high enough! Then he had a brilliant idea.

As Ibrahim walked towards the house for his birthday party, he saw a helicopter hovering over the backyard. The helicopter had something circular hanging from it. Ibrahim got closer and peeked into the helicopter, careful not to get an accidental haircut from the spinning blades. Inside was Uncle Ali, and the thing hanging from the helicopter was a layer of strawberry shortcake!

""Uncle Ali!” Ibrahim said. ""What are you doing flying around in a helicopter?”

""Well,” said Uncle Ali, ""for a shortcake it sure is getting awfully tall!”

Senet was played with two different sets of pieces (just like chess and checkers!). Instead of dice, some historians say that the Egyptians threw sticks to move pieces around the board.

But it’s hard to know exactly what the rules of Senet were. Historians have only found texts that explain bits and pieces of the game. Imagine ripping up the instructions to a new board game and then leaving it lying around for a few thousand years! But historians also note that the rules of Senet have probably changed over time anyway. So, some people have made up their own rules to keep playing this ancient game in the modern day!

220,221,7,6,"Every night that week Mustafa had woken up to the same sound. He would be lying still in his soft bed, when suddenly the loud <i>CLANG</i> of metal on metal would make his eyelids shoot open in a jolt. Then came the sounds of digging. The soft shuffle and hiss of dirt being spilled over dirt, again and again.

The first time it had happened, Mustafa woke up confused and on edge in the dark. Once he realized that he had just been startled out of a dream, he relaxed a little and rolled over, ready to go back to sleep. But then he heard the digging coming from outside his window. 

Mustafa’s bedroom was on the first floor of their apartment building, and its window faced out into a beautiful gated courtyard. All the other apartment buildings looked into that courtyard and it was filled with trees, and flower beds, and wooden benches. During the daytime, the courtyard would be filled with little kids running around, and older folks sitting in the shade to read. But at night it was filled with nothing but shadows, and the tall black metal gates that surrounded it were firmly shut, chained, and locked.

At first Mustafa just lay there on his side, gazing out of his window, listening. He had never heard more than the mewling of a cat in the courtyard at night, and this was definitely no cat. From where he lay, he could just see the sharp pointed black tips of the gate glinting in the silvery moonlight, and all of the dark, dark night sky beyond. The sound of the digging continued steadily: a jab, a muffled patter of dirt, a low whispering sound as it scattered and slid.

Mustafa knew Joseph, the man who tended the trees and gardens in the courtyard. He knew that Joseph obsessed over his gardens, and only ever dug in them during the day because he believed that plants liked peace at nighttime, just like people. He also knew that Joseph was the only person with the keys to the courtyard gate. So, who was this digging in the courtyard in the middle of the night? And what were they digging for?

Mustafa no longer felt like going back to sleep. He didn’t think he could have if he tried. His heart was starting to beat a little louder in his chest, and he noticed that the hand gripping his blanket was sweaty. Slowly, he pulled the blankets back and slid out of his bed. He crawled across the floor to the window, not wanting his head to be seen. He paused just below it and crouched, listening.

<i>Jab, patter, whisper; jab, patter, whisper</i>– was it getting faster? Mustafa took a deep breath, held it, and inched his head up to peer through the bottom of the window. 

Fifteen feet from where Mustafa knelt, through the gate and across the grass was a large pit in the ground. Mounds of black earth were piled all around it, and a vivid orange glow was coming from its unseen depths. Closest to Mustafa were a couple of objects covered in dirt. The first was a large tattered book, leather-bound, but too filthy to read the title of. The other was a headdress of some kind, or a crown. Its metal was carved with detailed markings and it had jewels or stones embedded all across its surface. As Mustafa stared out at it, his widening eyes reflecting both the pale moon and the strange orange light, he finally let out his breath in a gasp as he realized: set into the crown were not jewels, or stones, but hundreds and hundreds of human teeth.

Suddenly a slow creaking sound rose up from the bottom of the pit and Mustafa ran back to his bed and jumped under the covers. Turning his back to the window he tried to steady his breath which was coming hard and fast. He tried closing his eyes, willing himself to go back to sleep and awake to find this had all been a terrible dream, but every time his eyelids closed the image of the crown was there waiting for him. Even under the blankets on that warm night, Mustafa lay there shivering for a long time before he finally fell asleep.



The next morning Mustafa rose slowly, sitting up and letting the smoky scent of bacon wash over him pleasantly before even opening his eyes. Once they were open, he blinked dully at a shadow on his wall, a shadow cast by the pointed tips of the metal courtyard gate.

And suddenly, with a feeling like an icy stone falling into his stomach, he remembered. Nearly tripping over his own feet in his hurry to reach the window, when he got there he breathed a deep shuddering sigh of relief. He even let out a little laugh. 

Looking out into the sunny courtyard, everything was just as it should be. A man with a coffee cup was on a bench reading a magazine. A woman and her small daughter were having a tickle fight under a large oak tree. No pit. No orange light. No crown. 

<i>What a terrifying dream that was! </i>Mustafa thought to himself. <i>I’ve really gotta cool it on those late-night movies Mom hates. Maybe there is such a thing as too-vivid an imagination.</i>

And he went to go have breakfast with his family.



That night Mustafa yawned and leaned back into his pillows, already wondering what his dad might be making for breakfast the next day when he gently drifted off to sleep. 

Then he heard a <i>CLANG</i>, followed by the unmistakable sounds of digging.

224,225,10,6,"Hank was almost done. It had taken him all day and he had used up his whole allowance, but he had built something incredible. Hank had built the world’s biggest, wackiest, waviest, kookiest, zaniest crazy straw spitball shooter ever! It was made of 1,999 individual crazy straws attached end-to-end. Every straw was a different colour and every straw was bent and twisted to make one giant <i>super</i> crazy straw! 

It started in his bedroom and spiraled up over his bookshelf– red, purple, yellow, green! It curved through the hallway and sloped down the stairs into the living room– blue, orange, pink, gold! It loop-de-looped around the cat and under Dad’s arms as he read the paper– turquoise, maroon, magenta, indigo!

225,226,11,7,"When they had finally made their way around the last big tree, they stopped and looked out into the dry, yellowing field. Krista took half a step forward, with a hand to her forehead to shield her eyes from the direct sunlight. Lou stood staring with her head slightly tilted and her eyes crinkled against the glare. 

It was difficult to tell whether there was anything there to see at all. They could feel the presence of something, some enormous something, but trying to look at it was like trying to see rain in the dark, or looking through a perfectly clear glass window on a bright day. But just then a gentle shiver seemed to ripple through the air itself, the way the road looks wibbly when the sun is scorching, and they knew the ship was still there.

Krista glanced back at her sister and smiled, then set off towards the center of the field. Lou followed. As they got closer, the shape of the ship came into clearer focus. It was almost the exact shape of a boat’s sail when it’s inflated by the wind, but had only a large, smooth sphere at its base. The whole structure was at least fifty feet taller than the tallest tree they could see. Standing beneath it, it seemed to be as big as the whole sky.

Krista opened her mouth, looking scared for the first time that day. ""Lou, I think–”

But just then, a shimmering staircase appeared before them leading up into the belly of the ship. Lou could hear the twittering of sparrows in some distant tree. Everything felt very still. Lou took Krista’s hand in her own, feeling the calluses of all that summer’s tree climbing and bike riding against her fingers, and led them up the staircase.

When they reached the inside of the ship, at first everything was dark. Then two glowing orbs of white light began to slowly pulse and grow until they had reached the size of basketballs. After that, other glowing objects began lighting up, one by one, all around them. They were all different shapes and sizes, and the colours reminded Lou of the tropical fish aquarium she had been to once on a fieldtrip. Eventually it was light enough to see that they were standing in the middle of a gigantic room full of these strange, lumpy, glowing shapes, and that the ceiling above them was covered in flickering lights, switches, and buttons. 

Then a deep purring hum rumbled out from within the walls.

The spider-bots all looked exactly alike: about the size of a small dog, they were made of dark, shiny chrome with rows of tiny white lights that ran down each of their eight legs, and had eight red and blue sensors like eyes. 

In the center was a gigantic spider web, and it looked like it was made out of pure light. It stretched 100 meters across in every direction and was slowly growing as more and more waves of spider-bots spun their contribution. Every thick strand seemed to pulse with energy and white light, while thin ribbons of code and language streaked through them. This was the World Wide Web...or it was going to be.

Maybe it was because she went to Magda The Magnificent’s Spectacular Circus School and lived in a bright blue house full of other circus students. Or maybe it was because she couldn’t always think straight unless she was standing on her head.

The morning routine in the circus house was always a bit crazy, but Leah loved it all. Breakfast usually began by trying to grab a plate from the tall stack of dishes that The Unbelievable Bogdan had balancing on the tip of his nose. (This was even more difficult on the days when Bogdan was practicing riding his unicycle at the same time.) Then Leon the fire-breather would lend his fiery breath to help cook the eggs or boil the water for tea. (The walls had burn marks here and there from the mornings when Leon was still a bit sleepy.) When Leah left for school, Maria was always there hanging upside down from the doorframe to hand everyone their lunches. (Maria’s long blond pigtails always tickled Leah’s nose and made her laugh.)

But walking into circus school was always the best of all. Everyday was like walking into a gigantic colourful circus tent! Leah never knew what she would see or hear that day (or taste or touch or smell for that matter). Some days she went to her locker to find Felix the Flexible all folded up inside it ready to yell ""Tada!”. One time The Amazing Amanda perfected her magic act by disappearing all of Leah’s homework. The halls were always packed with jugglers juggling jugs and people doing flips. In Magda The Magnificent’s Spectacular Circus School, no two acts were the same and that’s what made it wonderful.

236,237,3,8,"Trung Trac and Trung Nhi were two sisters who lived in Vietnam from AD 12- AD 43. They grew up in a small rural village in what would now be Northern Vietnam. They lived in an area called Giao Chi, which was ruled by China (and the Han Dynasty) at that time. The sisters were well-trained in martial arts from a young age because of their father’s position in government. 

As time went on, the relationship between the Vietnamese people and their Chinese rulers got worse. The Vietnamese felt that their people and culture were being attacked and cruelly mistreated. The Chinese were also trying to expand farther into Vietnam to control more of the South. Eventually, Trung Trac’s husband, Thi Sach, tried to stand up to the Chinese rulers and rebel. Unfortunately, his plan failed. The Chinese executed him as a warning to others not to try the same thing.

However, the murder of her husband inspired Trung Trac and her younger sister to do just that: they began to plot rebellion against the Chinese. In AD 40, the Trung Sisters were able to fight a small Chinese unit out of their own village. With the confidence and respect they earned from that, they began to build a large army of 80 000 people– mostly made up of other women (including their own mother)! During this time in ancient Vietnam it was very unusual for women to be warriors, and many people thought it was wrong for these women to be fighting. But the Trung Sisters didn’t care, and within a few months their army of women (riding on a herd of elephants!) had taken back 65 cities from the Chinese! They won freedom for the ancient kingdom of Nanyue, and both became its ruling queens! 

They successfully protected Nanyue from Chinese attacks for the next three years, until they were killed in battle in AD 43. Nobody knows exactly how the sisters died. Some records say that they fell at the hand of a powerful Chinese general, Ma Yuan. Another story says that the Trung Sisters were defeated when their male attackers tried fighting naked, and the mostly female army ran away out of embarrassment (but this is almost certainly just a story). Other records say that the sisters vanished into the sky, or threw themselves into a river and became stone statues.

No matter what happened to them in the end, the Trung Sisters are admired for leading the first resistance movement in Vietnam after 247 years of being ruled by China. Many temples have been built to honor the Trung sisters and there is an annual holiday in Vietnam to celebrate their story. Trung Sisters are still proudly remembered in Vietnam for their bravery and sacrifice.

The solid waste would later be removed and used for fertilizer. So next time you’re waiting for the bathroom, remember that you’re part of a tradition that goes all the way back to 1900 BCE!

240,241,8,8,"Now that Clara had narrowed down her list of suspects to three people, she was sure that she’d be able to figure out who had stolen the nose from the famous General Shnozz statue. As soon as the museum staff realized what had happened, they sealed off the scene of the crime with her entire class inside it. That’s how Clara knew that the guilty person– and the nose– must still be right there in the room with them. General Shnozz’s gigantic stone nose might be missing, but Clara was determined to sniff out the thief!

Clara’s first suspect was Drew Doodleson, but Clara wasn’t certain that Drew could have taken the nose even if he had wanted to. He was so allergic to the polish they used on all the statues in the museum that his nose had been running all day! Anyway, he was still on Clara’s suspect list because besides his allergies, he had another nose problem on his hands: Drew could draw almost anything, but he always said that noses were the hardest. Lately he had been complaining that none of his family members would sit still long enough for him to get the noses right in their portraits.

Suspect number two was none other than the dreaded Ms. Snootle! Ms. Snootle was their school’s vice-principal (and happened to be Clara’s least favourite grown-up in the world), but that was NOT why she was a suspect. When the class had first entered this room on the museum tour to see the statue, Ms. Snootle had been deeply offended by the large size of General Shnozz’s nostrils. Clara and the other kids had tried to explain to her that here in the museum, General Shnozz’s gigantic booger caves were ""art”, but Snootle wouldn’t listen. Instead, Ms. Snootle simply turned her big grey bushy head away from the statue to shield her eyes, and began yelling at the tour guide about ""the importance of modesty in this day and age!” 

The final suspect was Annie ""The Android” Anderson. Annie loved robotics and was always tinkering with some gizmo or gadget. Lately she had been bragging about the life-size robot she was building that was going to help her get double servings of dessert from the cafeteria at lunchtimes. Apparently, the only problem with it was that she hadn’t been able to make the robot’s face look exactly human yet, since all it had were bottle caps for eyes, a tube of lipstick for a nose, and an old pencil case as a mouth. And Annie had told Clara just that morning about how her mom was starting to wonder where her favourite lipstick had gotten to.

As Clara weighed the clues and motives in her head, a member of the museum staff asked everyone to check inside their bags and pockets for the nose. As everybody stuck their heads inside their backpacks and coats, Clara heard a muffled sneeze, and that’s when she knew that she’d caught the culprit!

241,242,3,8,"Between 37 AD and 41 AD, ancient Rome had an emperor named Caligula, and Caligula had a pet horse. Caligula was not the world’s most popular leader, so a lot of people made up stories about him to make him look bad, or silly, or crazy. Since Caligula lived such a long time ago, it’s hard for historians to know exactly which of these stories are true, and which ones were made up or exaggerated. But we do know that of all the horses Caligula had (which was a lot!), he had a favourite: Incitatus. In Latin, ""incitatus” means ""swift” or ""fast”, and Caligula thought Incitatus was the coolest, fastest, most beautiful horse in all the land!

But some stories say that Caligula’s love for Incitatus went even farther than that! Some stories say that Caligula gave Incitatus a stable made of marble and a feeding trough made of ivory! They say that Caligula clothed his horse in the expensive and rare purple blankets that were meant only for royalty, and that he ordered REAL GOLD to be mixed in with Incitatus’ oats! Some records even say that Caligula had a special collar made for Incitatus that was covered in shiny precious stones.

But the craziest story of all is that Caligula was planning on putting Incitatus in government! According to the legend, Caligula wanted to make Incitatus a ""consul” which was a very important and high-ranking elected position in the Roman government, sort of like a senator. (I guess if the horse disagreed with any laws being passed, he could just shout out ""Neigh”!) Caligula even ordered that a large house would be built and filled with servants so that Incitatus could greet and entertain visiting politicians and royalty from other lands! Some people say that Caligula wanted to make Incitatus a consul as an insult to the other senators (""your job is so easy my horse could do it!”). Other people think that Caligula was just a crazy guy with a thing for horses. But, whether Caligula was serious or just horsin’ around, it is clear that Incitatus was a horse for the ages!

242,243,6,3,"Abigail tossed the stone. It skittered along the pavement and landed halfway down the hopscotch court. Six. She raised her left foot and started hopping. Helen sat by the side of the driveway, watching. 

“Abigail,” Helen said. “Do you think that our mothers will be friends?”

Abigail wobbled on her leg but didn’t fall. “Why shouldn’t they be?” she replied. She glanced over at Helen. Helen’s pink dress just about glowed against her dark skin in the prettiest way Abigail had ever seen. Abigail’s skin didn’t look like that. Neither did any of her friends’. 

“I don’t know,” Helen said. “It’s just that at our last house, the lady next door didn’t seem to like us. She was always giving me and Momma mean looks from her window.”

“Did you ever do anything real rotten to her?” Abigail asked. 

Helen thought about it. She was braiding the short grass between her crossed legs. “I sure don’t think so. We had hardly lived there for any time at all when it started. Maybe she didn’t like my daddy talking so much about the Lord. Some folks don’t like that. But he’s a preacher! What else is he gonna do?”

“Your daddy’s a preacher?” Abigail asked excitedly. She bent low to pick up the stone and fell over. “Your turn,” she said.

“Yes, he sure is!” Helen said proudly. She stood up and took the stone from Abigail. “He preaches every Sunday at the church on Winnow Street. Everybody there just loves him!” Helen tossed the stone. Eight. She started hopping.

“Wow! I’ve never been to a colored church!” Abigail said, sitting down. “We always go to the same old one we always go to.”

Just then Mrs. Benson banged the front door open. Abigail and Helen both looked up. Helen stood frozen with one foot in the air. 

“Abigail Benson,” she cried, “what do you think you’re doing with that girl? You stop that and come away from her this instant!”
"
243,244,6,4,"Cecile was excited to go to the New World. She knew her mother was excited too, but sometimes she looked scared. They had already been on the ship for three whole weeks! It was crowded and smelly, but Cecile didn’t care. 

She shared a very small room with her mother under the boat’s wide deck. The room was dark and wooden and the air was always damp. It was only big enough for one narrow bed, so the two of them shared. Every night Cecile was rocked to sleep by the waves below. In the darkness, her mother would stroke her hair and sing softly to her. The song was old and the words were sad. But Cecile never felt sad when she was on the ship. Cecile only thought about what her new life would be like!

She spent all day and night dreaming about what they would find when they reached shore. She knew she would see her father again. That much was sure. It had been three years since he left them at home in France, but it felt to Cecile like much longer. She would be eleven by the time they reached the New World. Would he even recognize her? She hoped so.

Sometimes Cecile would take out the book of stories she had brought from home. It was the only thing that she had packed herself. It was her favorite thing in the world. Since there were no windows in their room, she had to use a candle to read– even during the day time. She wasn’t supposed to do it. They were supposed to save the candle wax. But Cecile did it anyway. She loved reading about the wizards and knights. Maybe when they reached shore Cecile would find dragons waiting for her in the New World.

244,245,6,4,"Yao ran as fast as he could through the market. He darted in and out (and sometimes through the legs) of people in the crowd. His bare feet beat dust clouds out of the ground. The sun was hot on the back of his neck. The air smelled like dirt, fish, and spices, just like always. As he ran he looked back over his shoulder. All he could see were cloth market stalls, wooden carts, and people, people, people!

People haggling for lower prices. People arguing over a clay pot. People yelling friendly hellos to each other. The hundreds of voices surrounded Yao like flapping birds. Just then Yao spotted the one person in the crowd he was dreading. Thinking fast, he dove into a large woven basket and ducked down. Keeping as low as he could, he peeked over the basket edge. 

The chicken vendor walked slowly through the crowd. He had an ugly snarl on his face. His hands were clenched into fists. He looked left and right, searching for a glimpse of Yao. But slowly, eventually, he was past the place where Yao was hiding. Yao let out a sigh of relief. 

The smell of fish was very strong all of a sudden. Yao moved his foot against something squishy. He looked down and saw hundreds of glassy dead fish eyes staring back at him! Of all the baskets in the market, he’d had to jump into this one.

245,246,6,4,"Charles crouched down and pretended to check the horse’s shoe. A brass key slid along the floor through a small hole in the wooden stable wall. Charles knew Edward must have been waiting on the other side. Charles picked the key up and tucked it into his leather boot. 

“OK, so you know the plan?” Edward whispered to Charles. 

“I think so,” Charles replied softly.

“What?” Edward said back in a whisper that was more of a yell.

“Yes, I think I know the plan: When Mrs. Fitzpatrick calls for the carriage to go to town, I bring the horses around like normal. After I saddle them, I unlock the carriage box. Then I go to fetch the bags.”

“That’s right!” said Edward. “While you are inside, I climb into the carriage and hide in the luggage chest. You come back and cover me with bags. Then we all set off for London together!”

“I’m not sure this is such a good idea, Edward,” said Charles. There was only silence from the other side of the wall. Charles could imagine the face Edward was making at that very moment. His blonde bangs a mess over his wrinkled brow. His mouth turned down in a thoughtful frown.

Finally Edward’s voice returned. “What are you talking about, Charlie my boy? This is my best idea yet!”

246,247,6,3,"“Good night, my lady,” said the maid servant. She blew out the candle and pulled the door behind her. Eleanor lay very still under her furs on the bed. She listened to the maid’s footsteps walking down the many stone stairs of the tower. Then she jumped up and ran to the chest at the end of the bed. Her long wool dress brushed the cold stone floor, and the moon shone through the opening in the wall that served as a window. She tapped on the lid.

“At last! I thought she would never leave!” Her best friend Richard popped out of the chest. He had a few bits of straw in his hair from the stables. “It was hard to sneak up here without anyone seeing!” But Eleanor wasn’t listening to him. Her eyes were fixed on a bundle in Richard’s arms. “Did you bring them?”

“No need to squawk! Here you are!” said Richard, handing her the bundle. Eleanor listened, but all was silent on the stairs. Her hands trembling with excitement, she unfolded the bundle. She held it up in awe. It was a pair of pants!

“More, more!” the children cried.

So the Pizza Fairy raised her magic wand again. Tomatoes appeared! And peppers too! Then onions, and mushrooms, and………...carrots? Then strawberries and chocolate chips! Then mustard, and bananas and dog treats! Everything on top of the pizza!

“No more toppings please!” the children cried. “Please, please, we want plain cheese!”

“Three wooden cups, all in a line,” he sang. “Find the marble, and you win what’s mine!”

The goblin started moving the cups around the table. He switched them back and forth. Then he switched them again! He switched them faster and faster until the cups were just a blur! Then all at once, he stopped. Three wooden cups sat side by side on the table. 

“Which cup holds the marble?” he growled. 

The second goblin pointed to the cup on the left. The first goblin raised an eyebrow.

“Are you sure?” he said.

	Casey didn’t know what it was, but she didn’t like it. It smelled like wet socks and metal. There was so much goo! It was going to spill out of the tub! Casey dropped her toothbrush and ran.

""What is that?!” he said to the empty room.

After a moment, he pushed the button. At once Floof jumped up! Her body froze. Her eyes opened wide. But now her eyes were flat and red with rows of tiny numbers running across them! Her mouth clicked open. Rashid jumped back.

She looked up. A big black crow had landed in a tree. The crow looked down its dark, shiny beak at her. Nelly smiled back up at the crow. Then, she went on her way.

She hummed as she walked. Suddenly the crow flew over her head again. It landed in a tree just ahead of her. It watched her walk. She looked at it again, but didn’t stop. Its sparkling black eyes met hers. She felt a cold shiver run down her neck. She passed the crow and started walking faster. Then she heard the flapping sound again. 

Nelly saw the crow land in a tree right in front of her.  She wasn’t humming anymore. She started to run. The sky was almost black. The flapping sound was closer now. She didn’t look back but she knew: the crow was right behind her.

No trees or buildings at all! This part of the desert always felt empty. But Linda knew there would be visitors there one day. That’s what she was waiting for. She was waiting for the aliens to come.

Linda had all the gear she needed. She wore a big floppy sun hat covered in shiny tin foil. She had a pair of binoculars. But best of all, Linda had a radio. 

Mostly the radio was just fuzzy with static. Sometimes it picked up a local radio station. She hated that. The music made it hard to hear. And Linda was trying to listen. Because sometimes odd sounds came out of her radio. Sounds like words she had never heard of before. Sounds that couldn’t come from human mouths. It was aliens speaking to Earth. Linda just knew it! And one day, she was going to speak back.

291,304,12,3,"A young boy had a goldfish. The goldfish swam in its fishbowl. The fishbowl sat on a table. The table stood near a window. Everyday, the goldfish gazed out that window. It saw the young boy and his friends on their bikes. They all hollered and laughed as they raced down the street. 

One day the fish had an idea. “I want to ride a bike, just like you!” the fish told the young boy. The boy loved the fish, so he agreed. He found a toy bike with one of his dolls. The goldfish jumped from its bowl and onto the bike. But riding the bike was difficult. The goldfish’s fins couldn’t hold the handle bars. Its tail couldn’t push the pedals. And pretty soon, it was even hard for the goldfish to breathe!

The boy put the goldfish back in its bowl. It cried and blubbered and looked very upset.

“I can’t even ride a bike!” the goldfish whimpered. “What good am I, anyway?”

The boy smiled. “You are as good as exactly one goldfish!” he cried. “And that is an excellent thing to be! You can swim all day long and breathe underwater! I don't know many bike-riders who can do that!”

292,306,5,3,"Dembe walked through the woods until he found a hidden place. He dug a small hole in the ground. He placed the magic seeds in the hole and then covered them up with dirt. Then he stared at the spot. He waited. But nothing happened! 

Then he realized: everything needs water to grow! So Dembe ran back through the woods to a stream. He collected some water in a wide green leaf.  When he got back, he sprinkled the water onto the place where the seeds were buried. And then he waited. And he waited. But nothing happened!

“Oh well,” Dembe said to the forest. “Maybe those seeds aren’t really magic after all.”

So Dembe went home with a heavy heart. The next day, Dembe came back to his hidden place in the woods. He thought maybe he would dig up the seeds again. Maybe they made a good snack, at least. But when he got to the place where the seeds were buried, he couldn’t believe what he saw!

Sitting there, covered in dirt was a little girl! She was wrapped in brightly colored silks. 

Her head rested on her knees and her eyes were closed. She seemed to be sleeping.

293,307,4,3,"Hakim gripped the horse’s mane tightly as they flew. The force of its powerful wings shot them higher and higher into the night sky. Hakim saw the lights of his town growing smaller below them. He saw the moonlight reflecting off streams. They looked like thin silver threads. Usually, he was afraid of heights. But right now, Hakim didn’t feel afraid. He wondered if he was dreaming.

He tried pinching his leg. It hurt. He could also feel the cold wind beating against his face. Maybe he wasn’t dreaming after all. But he was riding on the back of a flying horse! How could that be possible? He looked down at the horse’s mane. The hairs were thick and coppery.

“Um, excuse me!” Yazelda called from behind him. “Sorry, it’s just that I can hear all your thoughts. Remember? You're not dreaming. Also, that thing you’re riding isn’t a horse. It’s a pegasus. Try to keep up, will ya?”

294,308,4,3,"Sirvat was furious! She was a witch for goodness sake! Some creepy old man wasn’t going to speak to her that way! And then it all suddenly clicked.

“Oh wait! I’m a witch!” she said aloud. A few people in the market looked around at her.

She ducked behind a shelf of olives, making sure the old man was still in view. She spotted him a few lanes down, frowning at a carton of milk. Sirvat pulled out her wand and tucked it into her sleeve. Then, very slowly, she pointed it right at the back of his head! She whispered a spell under her breath. And she waited.

It worked right away! Long grey tufts of hair sprouted out of the old man’s ears! The hair kept growing and growing! It spilled down his neck and shoulders. He didn’t even seem to notice! But other people certainly did. Mothers started to move their children away from him. People pointed and sniggered behind their hands. Finally, the hair reached all the way down to his knobbly knees. At last, he noticed. Following the long strands of hair back up to his ears, the old man gave a loud yelp! Then he jumped up and ran out of the store.

“So there!"" she whispered. ""That’s what you get for messing with Sirvat the Witch.""

295,309,8,3,"Anton and Leon walked towards the Big Cats display. It was a hot and crowded day at the zoo. Anton was wearing a yellow t-shirt with a large fuzzy bumble bee on it. He had just bought it in the zoo's gift shop. ""Bees are the unsung heroes of the animal world, you know!” he had said to anyone who would listen. Leon was looking at the map to find the Bat Caves. He loved how cool and dark it was in there. It made him feel like he was deep deep underground.

But first they would go see the Big Cats. Lions, tigers, cheetahs– the zoo had them all! But when they got close, they saw that something was wrong. A sheet was draped over the Lion Display. It had a sign over it that read: LIONEL THE LION HAS GONE MISSING. DISPLAY CLOSED UNTIL HE IS FOUND. 

Anton read the sign over Leon’s shoulder. ""How do you just lose a whole lion?” he asked. ""I sure hope it isn’t wandering around looking for a snack. We’re some of the slowest animals in here!”

""No way,” Leon replied. ""They wouldn't open the zoo with a lion running around! Let’s just go check out the tigers.”

They joined the crowd around the tiger display. There was a male, two females, and a little cub. All the tigers were asleep on a rock in the sun. Anton stepped closer and pushed his nose against the glass window. There was something strange about the male tiger. It looked like the top of its head had been shaved. And something was off about its stripes, too. Anton looked closer. Was one of the stripes...dripping? Yes, it was! Because the stripes were actually drawn with paint!

""Anton,” Leon said quietly. ""I think I’ve found Lionel the Lion.”

296,310,8,3,"Greta loves slimy animals. She has read every book on lizards in the library. She has her own worm farm at home. She voted for the class pet to be a snake. She was very upset when we chose a hamster instead. Just last week I heard her talking. She said: “The more frogs the better!”

Stavros loves hiding things in people’s desks. He thinks it's the world’s funniest prank. He left cold spaghetti in Kelly’s desk. When she reached in, she thought it was guts! He filled up Dave’s desk with marbles. He tried to grab his pencil case, and the marbles spilled out everywhere! He even put a spider in his OWN desk. Just for the fun of it!

Lani isn't usually one for getting her hands dirty. But she’s been really mad at me lately. Ever since last week, when I sat on her art project. How was I supposed to know her self portrait was on my chair? After that she was HOPPING mad. She said that she’d get me back one day.

It could have been any of them. But which one of them filled my desk with slimy frogs?

297,311,10,2,"Asher loved the lamp at his aunt’s house. It didn’t turn on with a switch like normal lamps. You didn’t push a button or pull a chain. No. To turn this lamp on, you had to clap. 
	Clap clap, on! 
	Clap clap, off! 
	Asher could sit there and do it all day. It was like magic! 
	Sometimes he would try different sounds. Not all the sounds worked. 
	He banged the pots. Bang bang, on! 
	He slapped his bare belly. Slap slap, nothing. 
	He knocked on the walls. Knock knock, off! 
	He stomped on the floor. Stomp stomp, on! 
	He snorted like a pig. Snort snort, nothing. 
	Some sounds worked better than others. But the only sound that always worked was clapping. 
	That’s why Asher was sitting with the lamp when his little sister came in. He was practicing the perfect clap. She jumped into the room in her hot pink tutu. She had sparkly goop smeared across her cheeks.
	""Clearly you are ready to clap,” she said, her nose high in the air. ""That’s good. Because I am ready to perform! I am ready for my spotlight!” She stepped into the glow of the lamp. Then she started her ballet steps.
	Asher looked at her and rolled his eyes. Clap clap, off!

298,312,10,3,"Klara picked wild flowers on the grassy hill. She gave a name to every one she picked. The lacy white one was Melinda. The sunny yellow one was Bigsby. The silky red one was Tamara. She didn’t know where the names came from. But as she met each flower, their name just popped into her head. She liked to pick a bunch so that they would all have friends. She thought the flowers talked to each other sometimes. But she had never heard them. 

When she got home she would put all the flowers in a glass jar. Then she would give the jar to her mother. Then her mother would put the jar on the kitchen table in the sun. Klara wanted to put every color of the rainbow in that jar. So she had a lot of flowers to pick. 

Klara walked farther up the hill. The grass swayed gently against her ankles. When she got to the top she looked across the shining river. A small wooden hut stood there. Klara had never seen it before. She could smell the wood smoke coming from the chimney. Had it always been there? She didn’t think so. She asked the flowers. They didn’t say anything. But Klara felt like they agreed with her. 
"
299,313,12,3,"There once was a mountain as tall as could be. Some people say it had been there since the beginning of time. Its tip dragged through the bottoms of clouds. The mountain saw everything that the sun could touch. It knew the great forest to the north. It knew the wild jungle to the east. It knew the wide plains to the west. It knew the shining sea to the south. It stood there proudly for years and years and years. 

But age wore the mountain down. In time the tall mountain was no more than a hill. Grass settled on its rounded top. A little town grew up on its side. The hill saw everything for miles around. It knew the animals that walked the land. It knew the birds that flew in the sky. It knew the people who worked and danced. It knew the mood of every season. It stood there proudly for years and years and years. 

But age wore the hill down. In time the round hill was no more than a boulder. Scratches marked its hard faces. It sat on the edge of that little town. But the little town had grown into a big town. The boulder saw everything that happened in town. It knew the lights of the pub and the shops. It knew the carts that rolled through the streets. It knew the children that played in the alleys. It knew the cats that walked along the fences. It stood there proudly for years and years and years.

But age wore the boulder down. In time the large boulder was no more than a rock. The rock was no bigger than a basketball. It sat below a great leafy tree in a park in the middle of town. But the big town had grown into a big city. The rock saw everything about the tree. It knew the shape of each different leaf. It knew the birds in every nest. It knew each nook of the tree’s bumpy bark. It knew the twists of the tree’s many roots. It sat there proudly for years and years and years.

But age wore the rock down. In time the small rock was no more than a pebble. It was very smooth and very small. It had been kicked and rolled all through the city. Until one day it landed on the edge of a beach. The pebble looked out at the shining ocean. It remembered when it had reached higher than the clouds. It remembered every season it had seen. It remembered every person and every animal it had known. It remembered the land before this city. The pebble was proud of the things that it knew. 

Then a little boy walked by and picked it up. He held the pebble in his warm hand. Then laughing and pointing, he threw it into the water. 


"
300,314,5,3,"Once upon a time there was a very evil queen. Her name was Queen Dreck. Queen Dreck didn’t care about her subjects one bit. She cared about them even less than she cared about the little children in the orphanage (which was not very much at all). She forced servants to lie down in mud puddles to keep her shoes clean. She bragged to the poor about the feasts she ate. She often kicked puppies out of her way! She was greedy. She was mean. Nobody in the whole kingdom liked her. But there was nothing they could do!

Queen Dreck had the magic crown. Whoever had the magic crown got to rule the kingdom. Nobody knew how she got it. Some people think that she stole it from the last Queen’s daughter. Others think that she stole the daughter’s whole head! However she got it, she wasn’t ever going to give it up. Many people had tried to take it from her. Everybody had failed.

Queen Dreck was as sneaky as she was evil. She was good at keeping the magic crown safe. She walked everywhere with strong armed guards. The castle was protected by a moat of flame. When she slept, she held the crown to her chest. She always slept lightly, ready to attack any thieves. That was bad news for thieves, because Queen Dreck was a master of karate.

Queen Dreck was sneaky, but Wigaldo the Wizard was smarter. Wigaldo lived in the castle too. The Queen used him to make poisons for her enemies. But Wigaldo was done with all that now. He only had one last poison to make. And it was for Queen Dreck! Wigaldo crafted a poison that would put the queen in a deep deep sleep. Then he could snatch the crown! 

He made the poison and mixed it into a pot of tea. Just as he was about to leave with it, he had an idea. With one small fix, his plan was ready. He took the tea to Queen Dreck’s bedroom.

“Your Majesty, Queen Dreck, I have your bedtime tea,” he said.

“I see,” said Queen Dreck, raising her eyebrows. “But why have you made it for me, Wigaldo? I usually make the blind maid do it. I like to see her spill the hot tea on herself as she tries to climb the stairs.”

“I was in the kitchen when it was ready, Your Majesty,” Wigaldo said, thinking quickly. “It was my honor to bring it here to you.”

“I see,” Queen Dreck said again. “This isn’t a trick, is it, Wigaldo? I hate tricks. Unless they’re mine. I think you should drink the tea first. Just to make sure there is nothing wrong with it. You wouldn’t want anything bad to happen to your Queen. Would you?”

“Of course not, Queen Dreck,” Wigaldo said. He poured himself a cup of tea. He took a deep breath. And he drank. 

But what Queen Dreck didn’t know, was that none of the tea was reaching Wigaldo’s throat! Clever Wigaldo had tied a small sack to a tooth. It was now sitting empty inside of his cheek. As he poured the tea into his mouth, it only filled up the sack!

Wigaldo put down the empty cup and licked his lips. “Are you ready for your tea now, my Queen?” he said.

Queen Dreck frowned. “Yes, Wigaldo,” she said. “I would have liked to see something bad happen to you. But I will have my tea instead.”

So Wigaldo poured a nice full cup of tea for the queen. She drank it down in one big gulp! A moment later, she was fast asleep. Wigaldo snatched the magic crown from her head. Queen Dreck didn’t stir. Wigaldo ran from the room and into the streets. He waved the crown high above his own bald head as he ran.

“We are free! We are free!” he cried with joy to the cheering crowd. And they were.
"
301,315,8,3,"Ravi was in the school library. He walked slowly down the narrow path between two tall shelves. He ran his finger along the dusty spines of books. He was looking for a mystery novel he hadn’t read yet. Ravi liked the detective stories best. Finally he spotted one he didn’t know. The spine was fat and blue. It’s title read: THE MISSING MAMMOTH MYSTERY. Ravi pulled it out from the shelf. But through the gap between the books, he saw something strange! A wide blue eye watching him from the next row over! The eye blinked once, and disappeared. Whoever had been watching him was on the run!

Ravi ran to the end of his row. He made a sharp right turn. He heard carpet muffled footsteps fading away. But by the time he turned to look, it was too late. Ravi saw the end of a red ponytail whip around the far corner. He knew that by the time he got there, they’d be gone. At least now he knew that whoever it was had blue eyes, and long red hair. He took out his notebook and wrote that down.

Then Ravi walked back to the mystery section. He had dropped his new book in the heat of the chase. But who would want to spy on him? And why would they be so afraid of being found out? Ravi had no idea. It was all very strange. 

Ravi returned to the row he had been standing in before. He found his poor book lying there on the floor. He picked it up and walked over to a row of plump armchairs. Then he sat down to read. He opened it up to the very first page. But then he heard something behind him. It was somebody breathing! Somebody was standing right behind him! 

But Ravi didn’t move. He played it cool. Slowly, he pulled a small mirror out of his pocket. He always kept one in there for moments like these. He held the mirror against the book’s inside pages. Then he raised the book up in front of him like he was reading. Finally he could see behind him in the reflection. It was one of those spinning metal bookshelves. It was full of brightly colored books of all kinds. He couldn’t see anyone there at all! But then he saw something right at the bottom of the shelf. A pair of purple sneakers!

Ravi jumped up out of his chair! He wanted to catch this spy in the act! 

“Gotcha!” he cried, twisting in the air. But he was only met with a quiet squeaking. The metal bookshelf was spinning around and around. The purple sneakers were gone.

Now Ravi was really curious. He had to know who this spy was. He had to find out who had sent them. So Ravi went into full detective mode. From the direction the shelf was spinning, he guessed which way the spy had gone. He turned up his shirt collar to hide his face. He walked on his tip-toes for ultra quiet sneaking. He hid behind book displays. He hid behind teachers. Finally he reached the other side of the library.

And there behind a door he saw them! The purple sneakers! Ravi ran over and pulled the door open. A girl in a trenchcoat was standing there. She had purple sneakers and red hair tied in a ponytail. Ravi knew her eyes were blue, but he couldn’t see them behind her dark sunglasses. 

“Oh all right!” she yelled at him. “What do you want? Why are you spying on me?” The nearby librarian shushed her.

Ravi couldn’t believe it. Him spying on her? No way! “What do you mean?” Ravi yelled back. “I wasn’t spying on you! You were spying on me!” The librarian shushed them again.

“But you just snuck over here like a sneaky spy!” She whispered this time. 

“That’s because I thought you were sneaking up on me!” he whispered back.

“Oh. Pretty good sneaking. I’m Mabel.” she said. She stuck her hand out at Ravi.

“You’re pretty good too,” he said. He shook her hand. “I’m Ravi.”

“Hey,” Mabel said. “Have you ever thought about being in a detective duo?”

“Only all the time!” Ravi replied. “Let’s do it!”

Ravi and Mabel high-fived. It made a loud and satisfying SMACK! They both grinned as the librarian kicked them out of the library.

302,316,10,3,"“Please just get it out of here,” Wyatt’s dad called from the bathroom. “You know the rules. Nothing with more than four legs in the apartment.”

“Fine,” Wyatt huffed. “But I don’t get why it’s always my job. You trapped the thing! How come I have to take it out?”

“It’s about being a team player, hon,” came his dad’s reply. Wyatt could hear him washing his hands again. “Molly found it in the sink. And she, uh, raised the alarm.” Wyatt could still hear her sobbing in the next room. “I chased it around and trapped it. It almost took some of me with it, too. Now you just have to bring it downstairs and set it free. Everyone does their part.”

“Ugh, fine. Here I go!” Wyatt called. “But if I’m not back in five minutes, call the fire department. Tell them it ate me alive! On your orders!”

Wyatt kneeled down. He lowered his face to the level of the glass. Trapped inside was a big, disgusting centipede. It was crawling all over. Its creepy little legs were wiggling like crazy. 

“Gross,” said Wyatt. Then he took a deep breath.

Wyatt slid a take-out menu under the glass. He was careful not to leave room for the bug to crawl out. Then he picked up the glass– menu, bug, and all. Holding it at arm’s length, he walked out the front door.

Wyatt’s family lived in an apartment building. All the windows had screens on them. And they lived on the 11th floor. That meant that Wyatt had to bring the bug all the way down to the lobby just to let it out. Wyatt reached the elevators.

He had one hand on the menu under the cup. His other hand was planted firmly on top of the cup. He was NOT going to let that thing get out until they were outside. But it left him no hands for the elevator button. He crouched down and pressed it with his elbow.

“You’re just lucky you didn’t end up in a bug-crushing household,” Wyatt told the bug. “My dad doesn’t like to kill things. Even gross-out things like you. I guess I don’t either. But I don’t like being your personal driver much better.”

The elevator dinged and Wyatt got in. Using his elbow again, he pushed the button for “lobby”. He looked into the cup. The centipede was racing around inside. It crawled up the sides and back down again. It ran around and around. 

“Wow, you’re fast!” Wyatt said. “You must be pretty scared, huh? I would be pretty scared if I was you. Some weird looking giant traps me in a tank and runs off with me? Yeah I’d say that’s nightmare fuel for sure.”

Wyatt watched the floor numbers light up as the elevator went down. 9...8...7. He looked into the cup again. He brought it a little closer to his face. The centipede had stopped running. It was standing on the side of the glass. Its long skinny antenna waved slowly back and forth.

Wyatt laughed. “It looks like you’re waving at me!” he said. “Helloooo in there!” Wyatt tilted the glass a little. The centipede didn’t move. “It’s cool that you can crawl up walls,” he said. “I wish I could do that. Then you could see the whole world upside down! With that plus your speed, you’d make a good superhero. We could call you Captain Critter!”

The elevator rumbled down a few more floors. 4...3...2. Wyatt had a strange feeling. He was almost at the lobby. He was almost done with this gross, icky job. But he felt sad. He didn’t want to lose Captain Critter. 

The elevator dinged again. The doors slid open. They had reached the lobby. Wyatt could see the big glass doors to the street. But he didn’t step out. 

No, Wyatt crouched again and pushed the number 11 button with his elbow. The doors slid shut. Wyatt looked at Captain Critter and smiled. His dad was not going to be happy about his new pet. 
"
303,317,10,3,"It was the last few minutes of the last soccer game of the season. The finals.  Whoever won this game, won it all. And Miranda wanted to win more than anything.

The sky was a clear, cloudless blue. The late afternoon sun was bright and golden. Miranda could see it glinting off the table of trophies. Parents, siblings, and kids from other teams lined one side of the field. Some were sitting in the grass. Some were munching hot dogs. But all eyes were on the game. The score was 1-1, with just 3 minutes to go.

Miranda looked out at her teammates. Every member of the Panthers wore a royal blue jersey. Each one had their number on the back. They were scattered across the field, but they flowed together like water. They ran in almost perfect step. They passed the ball like they were mind-readers. They had practiced and practiced for this. And they were good. Really good. But there was a problem.

For every royal blue jersey, there was an orange jersey to match. The Rockets. They weren't a very good team. But they played rough. That was the problem. The girls on the Rockets had a bad habit. They liked to foul players when the ref wasn’t looking. Their coach never seemed to be looking either. And when they did get called, they were suddenly all smiles and pigtails. But what did grown ups know about what happened on the field, anyway? On the field it was kids vs. kids. The rest was just details. 

And now they had reached the final game. The game they had been working for all season. They had to win. 

Miranda saw the ball come sailing towards her. She ran and met it as it landed. She ran faster, tapping the ball along with her. She was almost at the Panther’s net! But just then a defender popped up in front of her. The girl was like a human wall. Miranda couldn't get past her. She looked around quickly. Her teammate Vanessa was on her left! She passed the ball to Vanessa and Vanessa took the shot! The ball soared towards the net. But the goalie’s hands were too quick! The goalie punched the ball away. It flew off behind the goal post. 

The whistle blew. Corner kick for the Panthers. Miranda checked her watch. Just one minute left in the game. This was going to be their last chance. Kaitlyn went to take the corner. Kaitlyn had a kick so powerful that she had dented a parking sign once! Almost every member of the Panthers crushed in around the net. It was all a jumble of blue and orange. The whistle blew again. Kaitlyn took the kick.

With a powerful THWACK the ball spun high in the air! It arched over the first few players. Miranda watched it like it was happening in slow motion. She saw the ball starting to drop towards her. She saw the goalie drifting towards the left side of the net. She felt a Rockets player tugging on her jersey. She jumped up and headed the ball! The Rockets goalie reached for it, but it was no use. The ball plunged deep into the right side of the net! 

Nobody heard the final whistle over the screams of joy from the team and the crowd. Everyone rushed the field! They had done it! They had won!

306,320,4,5,"The sorceress stepped slowly out of the heavy mist. Her dark hood was up and her head was bowed, concealing her face in shadow. In her hands she held a glowing blue orb, whose contents seemed to swirl and twist.

"
325,339,7,5,"Mara walked through the bustling carnival, trying to see where her friends had gone. It was starting to get dark. The colored lights blinked wildly on the midway and the ferris wheel, filling her eyes. Every so often, shrieks pierced the air all around– from laughter or fear, Mara couldn’t tell. The smells of salty popcorn and frying oil were everywhere. Bodies pushed her this way and that until something stopped her in her tracks. She turned and saw a strange man staring wide-eyed at her. He sat in a booth beneath a banner that read: FORTUNES. He had dark eyes and bony, pale face. He drifted towards her. 

When his face was just inches from her own, he whispered, “Your doom is coming, Mara. Very soon.”
"
326,340,8,5,"""I didn’t do nothin’!” Robert yelled, retreating into a corner. ""I didn’t do nothin’ and you can’t prove I did!”

""Oh give me a break, Robert!” I said, edging closer to him. ""We all know you stole the mayor’s ring. We know it, you know it. So enough with all this denial junk. Just cough it up already, will ya?”

Just then Robert’s furious, heaving breaths started turning into guttural grunts. His face turned red and he bent over, grasping his knees. Dry rasping sounds came up from somewhere deep in his throat. He sounded like my cat trying to pass an especially monstrous hairball. 
	Then, suddenly, with one final hack, a golden ring came flying out of his mouth! It soared gracefully across the room, spinning through the air as if in slow motion. Flecks of spit flew off of it in every direction. Finally, it tinkled to the floor right at my feet.

""Hey, you didn’t have to take it so literally, Bob,” I said, picking up the slimy ring. ""But that will do nicely all the same.”

"
327,342,4,4,"Gwindel dove into the dark, rough waves. Beneath the waves it was darker, still. He could hardly see more than a foot in front of him. The only light he possessed radiated from the amulet that hung around his neck. The cold seeped through his woolen clothes and into his bones. It was as though he could feel his very heart shiver inside his chest. But maybe that was out of fear, rather than cold. It was deathly quiet down here. But he had to reach the bottom.
"
328,343,5,4,"“I will turn you all into tasty little pies!” the witch cackled. “And at the feast tonight we’ll see just how much the people of this town adore children! They’ll love you so much that they’ll want seconds! Maybe even thirds!” she shrieked with laughter again.

The children of the town all began to back away from her, but they knew they were trapped down there in the kitchen. Just then Liza had an idea! She had to stop the feast from happening! As fast as she could she started throwing ingredients on the floor. She toppled the bags of flower and stomped on bunches of tomatoes. The other children joined in.

“You foolish runts!” the witch cried. “The more food you destroy, the hungrier our guests will be for the little food there is: YOU!”
"
329,344,7,4,"Lionel ran as fast as he possibly could. No looking back. There was nothing in his ears but the rush of cold wind and the high whine of fear. His legs were pumping so fast that they felt like jelly. It seemed miraculous that they didn’t simply fly off into the waiting, hungry darkness. His heart was beating so hard he thought it must be bruising the inside of his chest. He thought he might just puke it up any second all the same. His throat felt like a mangled tube of razor blades, but there was no chance of stopping.

<i>Run. Run.</i> The word that filled his mind. It was pounding like a drum inside his brain.

Then he heard the ravenous howl again behind him. Closer.

<i>RUN</i>.

330,345,8,4,"Jill swung the heavy door open into the darkened gym. It screeched loudly on its hinges. At first she couldn’t see anything inside at all, but eventually her eyes began to adjust. Not that there was anything to see in the darkness. It was just the big empty gym. Same as always. Why had the note told her to come here? What was she supposed to find? 

“Hello?” she called into the vast room. It was probably just some dumb joke. But since she was here already, she might as well check it out.

She stepped through the doorway and walked to the center of the floor. Every footstep squeaked and echoed through the big space. She looked up towards the high ceiling, trying to make out anything in the darkness.

SLAM! The sound boomed through the gym. Jill whipped around. It was only the gym door finally closing behind her. Now the darkness was complete. She reached a hand out in front of her face to see if she could see it. Then she heard something rustle behind her.

“Now we can talk,” said a voice from the blackness. “Now we’re alone.”

331,346,8,4,"Hanif trudged up the stairs to his apartment. His backpack felt especially heavy today. When he got up to the first landing, he found a green baseball cap lying there. It looked almost new.

""I don’t think that was there this morning,” Hanif said to himself. He thought about picking it up. It wasn’t really his style. He shrugged and kept climbing. 

But halfway up the next staircase, he found a long, blonde wig!

""That <i>definitely</i> wasn’t there this morning,” Hanif said. ""Someone must have really been losing their head!” Pleased with his little joke, he kept on climbing.

But soon he noticed a pattern. On the last step of the next flight, he found a pink jacket. After that he found a pair of sparkly bell-bottoms. And one large rubber boot! Something strange was going on here, and he was going to find out what.

332,347,10,4,"“How do spaceships get into space?” Nicole asked her big brother.

“Well, first they have to break through the atmosphere. That’s like a big invisible blanket covering the whole world,” Nelson replied.

“How do they do that?” said Nicole.

“They have to go really really REALLY fast!” said Nelson.

Nicole looked thoughtful. She tilted her head to one side. “I want to go into space,” she said.

“Yeah, one day I’d love to go into space too!” said Nelson.

Nicole walked out of the room. A few moments later, Nelson saw her flash past the doorway. She was sprinting down the hallway towards the living room. Nelson heard the sound of springs as she jumped up onto the couch. With a sickening lurch, he realized what was happening. But it was too late! The next thing Nelson heard was a big crash from the next room. The spaceship had experienced a failure to launch.

333,348,10,4,"Luna sat in her favourite tree. It was the perfect height for scouting. It also had big, strong, twisting branches. They grew in almost every direction. That was also good for scouting. Wide green leaves kept nosy eyes from seeing in, but still left gaps for her to see out. And best of all, the tree was in her neighbour’s yard! Luna had realized a long time ago that scouting from your own tree was for suckers. If the tree is in <i>your</i> yard, everyone knows that <i>you</i> must be the one in it. But nobody expects you to be in your neighbour’s tree. That’s just a fact.

334,349,12,5,"""I’m thirsty,” said one flower to another.

""Well that’s too bad,” the other flower said. ""You’ll just have to wait for it to rain.”

""But I’m thirsty right nooooooooow!” the first flower whined.

""Well then I guess you’ll just have to stretch those little roots of yours and find some water, won’t you?” the other flower replied. ""Either way, you better stop bugging me about it. I have enough bugs to deal with already.” At that moment, a large bumblebee sat on its face.

So the thirsty flower stretched its little roots, looking for water. It stretched as far as it possibly could. Then it stretched farther than it possibly could! It stretched and it stretched and it stretched. Finally, it felt a small <i>pop</i>, and a breeze on the tip of its root. The flower had stretched its little roots all the way to China!
"
335,350,5,4,"Taylor’s fairy godmother handed him a small pair of golden scissors. Though they were small, they were surprisingly heavy. They were also covered in fine carvings on every surface.

“With these scissors, you can do many incredible things,” she said. “For these scissors are far from ordinary. With them you can cut fabric into the most beautiful clothes the world's ever seen. You can give haircuts that the gods above will envy! You can cut copper and steel with the lightest of touches! But there is one thing that you must never do.” She leaned in close, peering over her glasses at him. “You must never use these scissors to cut paper. Do you understand?”

“But that’s just silly!” Taylor cried. “Who ever heard of a pair of scissors that can’t cut paper?”

“Well, for starters, YOU. Just now. That’s who,” she said grumpily. “And anyway, I didn’t say they <i>can’t</i> cut paper. I said that they <i>mustn’t</i>.”

336,351,4,4,"Dakan stood tall and proud on the crest of the high crimson mountains. The wind gently played at the hem of his cloak. His dark calloused hand held firm to the hilt of his great sword. The wide landscape below lay silent and empty. But Dakan knew it would not be so for long.

As though this thought had made it so, a low rumbling slowly arose. The sound was like the earth itself was growling. Then the ground began to shiver and quake. Dakan inhaled deeply. He could smell them coming on the wind. They were almost here. 

And then, suddenly, they were. The army was vast, and wave upon wave of bloodthirsty creature thundered past below. Now the rumbling was nearly deafening. Thousands and thousands of hooves, feet, and scales pounded their way across the scorched plain. That great roar was punctuated by the monstrous cries and gruesome shrieks of the fighters. 

Dakan raised his sword at the ready. He leapt lightly off the ledge and into the fray. The war had begun.

337,352,4,5,"Andaya gazed down into the pure darkness of the well. Something about it was calling to her, luring her toward its unknown depths. She felt as though she could almost reach out and touch the velvety blackness. Like it would swaddle and embrace her...

“What are you looking at?” Seema’s bright voice came like a slap to the face.

“Nothing!” Andaya said quickly, straightening up. “I was just looking into the well. Wishing, I guess.” She gave a small, embarrassed smile. “It’s silly, I know.”

Andaya looked into Seema’s face and was surprised by what she saw. Usually Seema was the very picture of cheerfulness and light, but just know it seemed like a cloud had passed over her. She looked concerned, perhaps even scared. 

“You haven’t been looking long, have you, Miss?” Seema asked. Was there a tremble in her voice?

“Um, no, not too long, no. I don’t think so,” Andaya stammered, taken aback by Seema’s serious tone.

“Good,” she replied. “It’s best not to be. You know what they say about that well, Miss?"" Andaya shook her head emphatically. Seema hesitated, then continued. ""They say that it’s cursed.”

338,353,10,5,"Elias did not want to go on this stupid trip. He didn’t want to pack all his stupid clothes into that stupid bag. As far as he was concerned, the family could go on their stupid vacation without him. That way everyone would be happy! He was already 12, after all. He didn’t need anyone taking care of him. What he did need, was independence. Independence to do what he wanted, and go where he wanted. Independence to spend the summer doing the only thing in their stupid town worth doing: climbing. Elias and his best friend, Pete were going to climb the Chief together that summer. The Chief was the second biggest, free-standing chunk of granite in the world! And they were going to climb it.

That is, they were going to climb it until Elias’ parents said, ""No."" His parents also said they were going to fly to the world's flattest place to visit his grandparents. In the middle of nowhere. And Elias really didn’t want to go on that stupid trip at <i>all</i>.

“So how old are you?” Allison asked Zoreep.

Zoreep thought about it for a moment. “Four hundred billion and two,” she said. “Sometimes I lose count.”

“Huh,” Allison said, also thinking. She leaned back in the sand. “So what do you do on your planet for fun?”

“You know, go star-surfing, chase wild galang-galangs, annoy my sisters. Just normal kid stuff.”

341,356,10,3,"Casey was a good dog who loved to have fun.

He loved to jump, and dance, and run!

He lived at home with his mom and dad.

He tried to be good, and not to be bad.

 

Mom and Dad worked in the big city, 

where thousands of glass windows shined, oh so pretty!

Casey stayed home and played all day long,

hiding in laundry, and barking dog songs.

 

Mom said, “Remember, be a good boy today!”

Casey looked up at her, and with a bark said, “Okay!”

Dad said, “Here is a nice new bone to chew! 

Because after all, that’s what good doggies do.”

 

Casey saw them leave as they drove down the street.

Then he leaped off the couch for his new tasty treat! 

He loved chewing bones, as everyone knew. 

Casey thought, “I’ll just chew this. That’s what good doggies do.”

 

Casey saw the cat at the end of the hall. 

He wanted to chase him, like his most favourite ball.

But then Casey remembered what his mom had said. 

“Don’t do that, Casey. You’ll scare that cat dead!”

 

The mailman brought letters to the door of their home. 

Casey wanted to bite him, like his most favourite bone.

But then Casey remembered what his dad had said. 

“Don’t do that, Casey. His pants will be shreds!”

 

Casey heard a bird chirp in the the yard. 

He wanted to scare him. It wouldn’t be hard.

But then Casey remembered what his mom had said. 

“Don’t do that, Casey. The bird’s pretty and red.”

 

Casey heard a mouse scratch at the door. 

He wanted to let him in to play some more.

But then Casey remembered what his dad had said. 

“Don’t do that, Casey. The mouse will eat our bread!”

 

Mom and Dad came home with smiles on their faces. 

All the things in the house were all in the right places. 

Mom said, “Guess who’s coming to the beach with us two?”

""Ok,” she says. ""One quick story.”

""Yes!” I shout.

I jump on my bed and slide under the blanket. Mom sits next to me. I hand her my favorite book, and she starts to read.

345,360,10,6,"Jeremy lived in a very tall building, in the middle of a very large city. At night, he could see all kinds of twinkling lights through the window of his twenty-third floor apartment. But Jeremy couldn’t see a single star in the sky.

When Jeremy was very young, his mother had taught him to say, <i>“Star-light, star-bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight.”</i> But whenever he gazed up at the night sky, even if he concentrated with with all his might, he couldn’t see a single star.

Jeremy’s mother explained that the lights of the city are so bright that the stars fade into the background, and become very difficult to see. “But then how do kids in the city make wishes?” Jeremy asked. His mother thought about it for a while, and then said, “You just have to be a little more creative.”

After that, Jeremy began finding stars all over the place. But instead of looking up, towards the empty night sky, he gazed down at the city, through his twenty-third floor window. The city, he found, was actually full of stars, after all. You just have to be a little more creative.

Jeremy made wishes on the blinking lights of airplanes, and on the blinking lights on the tops of tall buildings. He made wishes on the headlights of cars on the freeway (although these were more like shooting stars). And he made wishes on the lights of the city streets, on windy nights, when the treetops danced with the lampposts far below his twenty-third floor window.

Jeremy decided that he was actually pretty lucky to live in the city. “The city is so big and the sky is so small,” he thought to himself. For the little patch of sky that he could see between the tall buildings looked no bigger than a postage stamp. Jeremy figured that there were definitely more stars in the city than you could possibly fit into that tiny patch of sky.

Then, one day, Jeremy’s mother announced that his family was going on a camping trip in the country. Jeremy didn’t like the sound of that idea one bit. He had lived in the city his whole life, and had never been to the country. He didn’t want to leave his twenty-third floor apartment, and all of the twinkling stars of the city.

But, no matter how much he whined, and no matter how much he begged, his mother would not listen. “You’ve never been to the country,” she said. “How do you know you’re not going to like it?” But Jeremy was sure that there was nothing in the country that he would like more than the city.

The next day, they packed up the car and drove off to the country. Jeremy sat in the back seat with his arms crossed and sulked the whole way. They passed lots of trees and farms, and more trees and more farms, and the occasional house along the road.

One farm that they passed had a bunch of cows standing in a field. Jeremy’s mom said, “Hey look! Cows! You’ve never seen cows before, have you?” But Jeremy just continued to sulk. “Big deal,” he said. “You can see cows anytime on milk cartons.”

Another farm had horses, and his mom said, “Hey look, Jeremy! Horses! You’ve never seen those before either!” But Jeremy continued to sulk. “So what,” he said. “You can see horses anytime on TV.”

Finally, they arrived at their campsite and unpacked their things. Jeremy tried to set up his tent but it just turned into a big mess. The sheet got all tangled, the poles wouldn’t fit, and Jeremy got frustrated and sulked <i>even more</i>.

Then, they went for a walk in the woods and Jeremy got bitten by every mosquito. The bites left itchy red bumps all over his body, which his mother told him not to scratch. And Jeremy got frustrated and sulked <i>even more</i>.

Then, it started to rain and their clothing got soaked. They ran back to camp and put on dry things. But Jeremy still felt damp and uncomfortable. He was now very frustrated and sulked <i>even more!</i>

For dinner, they just had cooked hot dogs on sticks and baked potatoes wrapped in tin foil. Jeremy’s mom said, “It’s fun to cook on an open fire!” But Jeremy didn’t think that it was fun at all.

He was cold, and he was itchy, and very, <i>very</i> frustrated! Jeremy stood up and yelled at his mom, “I hate the country! I just want to go home!” Then he turned away from the campfire and stomped back toward his tent.

But away from the campfire, it was very dark, and Jeremy couldn’t see where he was going. His foot slipped on a patch of fresh mud and Jeremy fell straight backwards onto the cold, wet ground.

This should have made Jeremy even more frustrated – and it would have – <i>except</i> that at that very moment, when Jeremy opened his eyes, something amazing happened.

For the first time, when Jeremy looked up at the night sky, he could see stars, as far as the eye could see. And not just a few stars either. Hundreds of stars! Thousands of stars! Millions of stars! Zillions of stars! More stars than you could possibly imagine. “All of the lights in all the cities of the world would not be enough to fill a sky so big,” thought Jeremy. “It would take you a hundred lifetimes to wish on all of those stars!”

Then, Jeremy closed his eyes and concentrated with all his might on a very important wish. He looked up at the stars, twinkling above, and said, <i>“Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish, I wish tonight…”</i>

Afterwards, he continued to lie there, gazing up at the sky for several minutes. Finally, his mother called him from the campfire saying, “Jeremy, are you alright?”

“I’m fine,” said Jeremy with a smile on his face. Maybe the country wasn’t so bad after all.

A few days later, Jeremy’s family packed up their bags and drove back to the city.

That night, Jeremy looked out of his twenty-third floor window, as usual. But, instead of looking down at the lights of the city below, he looked up at the patch of night sky above him. A big grin appeared on Jeremy’s face when he saw that his wish had actually come true.

For there, in that small patch of sky, he could see a single star twinkling away. And when Jeremy saw it, he remembered that somewhere, way up high, above the tall buildings around him, there was a giant sky full of twinkling stars. And they were shining brighter than the lights of any city.

347,362,10,2,"My name is Michael. Some of my friends are kids. Some of them are not kids. Some of them are not even people.

I have a pet stick. I named him Henry. He is longer than my arm, and as thick as my thumb. He has a green mark on him that looks like the letter H. That’s why I named him Henry. Henry likes to go places with me.

""Henry, where do you want to go today?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go to the playground,” I say.

We go to the playground. Henry goes down the big slide with me. I hold him high in the air as we slide down fast.

""Henry, where do you want to go next?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go play in the sandbox,” I say.

Henry helps me dig in the sandbox. He digs better than a shovel. We dig a big hole around our castle.

""Henry, where do you want to go next?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go play soccer,” I say.

We practice kicking the soccer ball in the goal. I get many goals. Henry tries, but can’t kick the ball very far.

""Henry, where do you want to go next?” I ask.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s go play fetch with Daisy,” I say.

My dog’s name is Daisy. She loves when I throw things in the yard. I yell ""Fetch!” and she brings them back to me.

I wait for Daisy to get ready. I know that she’s ready when she barks.

Daisy barks, ""Woof!” I throw Henry as far as I can.

""Fetch!” I yell.

Daisy runs to Henry and picks him up in her mouth. Daisy runs back to me.

""Good girl,” I say. 

I pet Daisy on her head. Daisy has brown fur and it feels soft in my hands. She likes it when I pet her.

Henry is wet from being in Daisy’s mouth. I wipe him off on my shorts.

""Henry, do you want to keep playing?”

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. Let’s do it again.”

I pull my arm back and throw Henry even farther this time. Henry goes so far he lands in the woods. Daisy runs after Henry, but doesn’t come back.

""Daisy!” I yell.

Daisy is still in the woods.

""Daisy!” I yell again.

Daisy still hasn’t come out of the woods.

I run to the woods. I see Daisy. She is looking for Henry, but she can’t find him. I look at the ground. Now I know why Daisy can’t find Henry. There are hundreds of sticks in the woods and they all look the same!

I pick up many sticks and look at each one carefully. None of them is Henry. None of them is longer than my arm, and as thick as my thumb. None of them has a green mark that looks like the letter H. Henry is lost in the woods. 

Daisy brings me many sticks, too, but none of them is Henry. I sit down on a log and start to cry. Daisy comes over to me and licks my fingers. She sometimes does that when I’m sad.

No more riding on the slide with Henry. No more digging in the sand with Henry. No more playing soccer with Henry. No more playing fetch with Henry. I wipe my tears on my shirt sleeve.

""C’mon, Daisy. Let’s go inside.”

I stand up and walk back towards my house. Daisy follows me. 

That’s when I trip on a root. I land in a pile of even more leaves. As I get up, that’s when I see him.

""Henry!”

Henry was hiding under the pile of leaves, and I fell right next to him. He is longer than my arm, and as thick as my thumb. He has a green mark that looks like the letter H. Yes, it’s Henry! Henry is dirty from his trip into the woods. I wipe him off on my shorts.

""C’mon, Henry and Daisy. No more woods for us today.”

Mom calls me to come inside. It’s time for dinner. She won’t let me bring Henry inside the house, so I leave him on the deck.

""Where do you want to go tomorrow?” I ask Henry.

He doesn’t answer.

""Ok. We’ll just do it all again.”

Henry doesn’t answer. He’s the strong, silent type.
"
348,363,10,5,"First of all, no, we are not identical. Just because we sort of look alike doesn’t mean that we are identical twins.

Yes, Molly and I were born 12 minutes apart.

Yes, we have the same mom and dad.

Yes, we are both girls.

Yes, we both have blue eyes and curly brown hair.

Yes, we are both the same height.

That’s where it stops though. Everything else about us is totally different.

Molly loves reading. I’d rather rake leaves or clean windows than read a book.

Molly gets As on all of her tests. I’ve never even seen an A. Ever.

Molly loves shopping for clothes. I love shopping for sports equipment.

Molly’s name is easy to spell. My name, Kaitlyn, everyone spells wrong. 

See, we’re totally different. People always think we’re identical twins because at first they think we look the same. Once you look closely at us though, you could tell we’re fraternal twins. People don’t usually know the difference.

Fraternal twins are born one after another, just like identical twins. However, fraternal twins could be two boys, two girls, or even a boy and a girl. They also don’t look the same.

Like us.

Molly has a bigger nose. I have bigger lips. Molly also has a big freckle on her right cheek. I don’t.

Although we sometimes get annoyed when people get us confused, it does have its advantages. Like the time we pulled off the greatest twin switch in history. 

It all started at our new school. At the end of third grade, our dad got good news with his company. They moved him up to a vice-president or something. At first Mom was really happy, but then we found out we’d have to move because his new job was about five hours away.

Mom still pretended that she was excited. Molly and I knew better. She was just pretending because she knew Molly and I hated that we had to move. I was a little upset, but Molly was really mad. Molly said she wasn’t going, that she’d live in the basement of the school. Molly is known for being overly dramatic. 

About a year ago, Molly and I were out raking leaves when Molly poked her finger with a small branch. It was the tiniest cut in the world, but you would have thought she had her finger chopped off the way she was screaming. Dad came running out and carried her inside. Yes, she was actually carried inside. 

She got out of raking leaves for the next hour while she <i>rested</i> her finger. Mom wasn’t home at the time - she wouldn’t have fallen for Molly’s trickery. Dad still does though. He’s a sucker for her dramatics.    

Dad moved into an apartment a couple weeks later, until we could find a house. As a compromise, Mom stayed back with us so we could finish the last two months of the school year. The day that school finished, we moved, too.

It was a boring summer because we didn’t know anyone in Pegoria, our new town. About a week before we moved, Dad bought us a house. It was at the edge of this gigantic national forest, which meant that everywhere you looked all you saw were trees and mountains. We did have a cool lake in our backyard, but except for old Ms. Henderson, who lived by herself about a half mile away with her seven cats, there was no one else to play with anywhere near us. The population of the entire town was only 3,000 people! We were excited to start fourth grade so we could make some friends. 

We had never been in the same class before because our old school always wanted twins separated as much as possible. In Pegoria, that wasn’t an option. There was only one fourth grade class. 

We both had Mrs. Pritchett, a grey haired woman who looked like she had been teaching for fifty years. When Mrs. Pritchett introduced us, she mixed up our names.

Not exactly an unusual thing for us.

Normally, Molly jumps right in and corrects anyone who mixes us up. This time though, she didn’t.

I stared at Molly, expecting her to say something. When she finally did, it took me by complete surprise.

“Could you please both tell us a little something about yourself,” Mrs. Pritchett said. “Who would like to go first?”

Molly quickly raised her hand, and gave me a quick glance. I knew that look. A sly and mischievous smile coated in honey and syrup. A smile she’d used countless times to get her way. I knew it was trouble.

“Hi, my name is Kaitlyn,” Molly said. “I just moved here with my sister Molly. I love sports, helping out with chores around the house, and I have to admit, I don’t really like reading.”

The class snickered at the part about reading.

“Thank you, Kaitlyn,” Mrs. Pritchett said. “Alright, Molly. Tell us something about yourself.”

I looked up, realizing she was talking to me. I looked around. The entire class was looking at me. Molly just stood there, her hands clasped together, staring at me as well with her twisted smile.

I didn’t want to do it, but I didn’t really have a choice. I opened my mouth and said the words I would regret for years to come.

349,364,10,4,"Mrs. Malo is my third grade teacher.

In Spanish, <i>malo</i> means villain. A villain is the bad guy or girl in a movie. In the movies, the villain always wants to destroy the world.

Villain.

Yup, that describes Mrs. Malo perfectly.

I’ve been mostly lucky to stay off of her bad side. I’m not on her good side, because <i>no one</i> is on her good side, but at least I’m not on her bad side.

My name is Scott and I’m just a normal kid. 

I play soccer. I like to ride my bike. Both my sisters are annoying. 

My older sister, Amy, had Mrs. Malo when she was in third grade. Amy said that she is fair because she’s mean to everyone. Equally.

I don’t believe that. When you’re on her bad side, you know it.

There’s this one girl, Mariah, who accidentally spilled paint on Mrs. Malo’s desk back in October. 

It was a watery purple paint that my group was using for a project on the solar system. The paint was in one of those red plastic cups. Mariah was carrying it back from the sink when she tripped. 

The paint flew through the air, and splattered all over Mrs. Malo’s teacher stuff. All of her papers and whatever else teachers keep on their desks were covered in purple paint. 

The worst part was that Mrs. Malo was sitting at her desk at the time. When she looked up she had purple paint all over her face.

If I didn’t know better, I would have laughed.

It was really funny.

It was also super scary. 

Mrs. Malo’s face turned bright red, her lip curled up like an angry momma bear, and I thought she was going to spit fire out of her eyeballs. 

Mariah looked too scared to even cry. 

***

Kids from Mr. Boone’s room down the hall told us later that they heard the yelling through their closed classroom door.

“It sounded like a monster,” Miles said.

“I thought someone was being attacked,” Katie said.

“I thought the world was ending,” Devin said. 

We all (except Mariah) laughed about it later, but not until recess. Not until we were sure Mrs. Malo was far far away. 

Mariah is definitely on her bad side.

Mrs. Malo didn’t scream that loudly again until Derek joined our class.

It was a cold January day when he arrived. January 7 to be exact. 

We later knew it as the birth of Operation MML.

Mrs. Malo stood at the front of the classroom. She was behind Derek with her hands gripping his shoulders. She introduced us to Derek as “our friend from the west coast.” Derek just moved here from California. 

He looked like he was from California. Like one of those surfer kids. 

Floppy blond hair.

Big freckles. 

A summer tan. In January.

I remember exactly what he was wearing. A blue bathing suit and a black tank top. Did I mention it was January? There was snow on the ground and this kid shows up in a bathing suit. 

I instantly liked him. So did all the other kids. 

I’m pretty sure Mrs. Malo instantly hated him.

All the boys wanted to sit with him at lunch, but only eight kids are allowed at a table. I was one of them.

***

 

“Dude, what’s up with Mrs. Malo?” Derek said. “Does she ever smile?”

“No,” everyone answered at once.

We all laughed.

“No, seriously. Has she <i>ever</i> smiled?”

Heads shook no.

“Actually, there was one time,” I said. “Mr. Caramel came on the announce-”

“Wait,” Derek interrupted. “Some dude here is named Mr. Caramel?”

“Yeah. He’s the principal.”

Derek’s face broke into a huge toothy smile. “The principal here is named after a candy?”

“Ha! I never thought of it like that,” I said.

“Is the librarian named Mrs. Gumballs?” Derek joked.

Everyone laughed again.

“So anyway,” I said, after I was done laughing. “Mr. Caramel came on the announcements a few weeks ago in the morning. He said we were getting out of school early that day because we were getting a big snowstorm.”

“What do you mean, getting out early?” Derek asked.

“It means that we only have a half day of school,” I said.

“Whoa, that’s cool,” Derek said. “That doesn’t happen in California.”

“Yeah, and that’s when Mrs. Malo smiled.”

“She loves getting away from us,” Johnny said.

“Yeah,” Mason added. “She was probably happy to go home so she could yell at her cat.”

“But that’s it,” Ricky said. “She never smiled any other time.”

We all nodded in agreement.

Derek rubbed his hands together like a mad scientist.

“Well then, boys,” Derek said, looking at all of us with his giant grin. “Operation Make-Malo-Laugh is about to begin.”

We later renamed it Operation MML so the girls wouldn’t know what we were doing, but they figured it out the next day anyway. 

Lindsay was the one who found out. She’s the smartest kid in class. Nothing gets by her. 

It turns out that it wasn’t a big deal though. The girls were just as excited to be a part of it as we were.

Derek was our official leader, but he let everyone be a part of the operation.

Plans were made. 

Secrets were exchanged.

Operation MML had begun.

It was what made third grade the best and worst year of my life.

<b><i>11:45 AM </i></b>

<b><i>Mt. Everest Base Camp (Nepal)</i></b>

 

The food isn’t horrible, but it definitely isn’t my mom’s cooking. I just finished my lunch, this mushy mixture of rice and lentils called Dal Bhat. It seems like this is on the menu every single day. Now I am sipping a mug of warm Nepali tea. Before arriving in Nepal, I never even liked tea. Here, everyone drinks tea. Even kids.

I may only be 12-years-old, but now I’m just as hooked on this delicious beverage as everyone else in Everest Base Camp. 

My dad and I arrived in base camp one month ago, in mid April. I’d been dreaming about this trip for the past five years. When I was seven-years-old, I saw a television show about a boy named Jordan Romero, who became the youngest person in the world to climb Mt. Everest at only 13.

I told my dad I wanted to do that. Not just to do it. To beat his record. 

Most dads would laugh, but my dad is not like most dads. An experienced mountaineer himself, he was a member of the Seven Summits Club. That means that he has climbed the highest peaks on all seven continents. He became a member a few years before I was born, when he climbed Everest for the first time. Since then, he’d climbed Everest two more times, both on the Chinese side and Nepal side of the mountain.

It was five years of dreaming and preparation, but here I was, right at the bottom of the tallest mountain on the entire planet. Technically, I was too young to even try climbing it. It was very dangerous - people died every year trying to make it to the top. Last year they ended the climbing season early when a block of ice the size of a mansion came roaring down the mountain. The avalanche killed 16 guides, mostly Sherpas, and out of respect almost everyone left the mountain days later. 

Since the climb was so dangerous, you were supposed to be 16-years-old, but Dad knew I was ready. I climbed more peaks than many of the adults trying to go up this year. Dad also worked for the U.S. government and had a lot of connections with the Napalese. Somehow he made it happen. 

Finishing the last drops of my tea, I left the mug with Tensing, who was the expedition cook. He was also the coolest Sherpa on the mountain.

“Tensing, have you seen my dad?” I asked.

“No, dude. No dad here.”

Tensing was a member of the Sherpa tribe, a tribe that lived in the Khumba valley surrounding Everest. Without the help of the Sherpa people, trips to the top of the world would be impossible. Sherpas were a major part of any expedition to Everest, helping with everything from cooking to climbing.

Tensing also liked to call me <i>dude</i> for some reason. I was from Maine, where no one said dude, but Tensing thought every American kid said dude. I think he watched too many old American TV shows.

“Dude, eat. Eat more food,” Tensing said in broken English, his big toothy smile making me grin. “I make big feast today.” 

“No thank you,” I said, rubbing my stomach. “I’m stuffed. I’m going over to see Pemba. Please tell my dad where I am if he comes by.”

“Okee dokee, dude. If hungry later. Come eat.”

“Thanks. See you in a bit.”

I pulled aside the big yellow flap that covered our mess hall tent, and immediately pulled down my sunglasses. Even though it was cold enough to need a coat and hat, the sun was bright, which made you want to take off your hat and coat. It didn’t really make sense, but at 17,598 feet above sea level, a lot of weather things were strange around here. Even at base camp, we were higher up than every mountain in North America except Mount McKinley in Alaska, which I climbed last year. I would have been the youngest to climb it, but Jordan Romero was one month younger than me when he reached its peak!

 Everest Base Camp was so high up that we had to spend 10 days hiking just to get used to the high altitude. If you tried to go up too high too fast you could get really sick.

I saw Pemba sitting down on a rock, a few tents away. Pemba was one of the climbing sherpas with our expedition. He was also really good at soccer. 

Everest Base Camp was really just a giant tent city that only existed during its short climbing season each spring. The rest of the year the weather was too unpredictable to attempt a climb. It was full of large expeditions like ours that had big tents to hang out in and even watch movies, and tiny one-person tents for people trying to climb the mountain by themselves.

Pemba had been teaching me a few soccer moves over the past few weeks, but the ground was so rocky here that it wasn’t easy. It was also hard to play soccer for too long because the high altitude made you get tired very quickly.

“Pemba, wanna play soccer?” I yelled.

I felt dizzy for a moment and almost fell down. It felt like the ground was shaking.

Pemba looked up at me and smiled, but then quickly turned his head away toward the sound.

I heard it, too. 

Everyone did. 

It sounded like a cross between a giant tree snapping in half and a bomb exploding.  

Almost instantly, the boom progressed into a low rumble, almost like that of an oncoming train.

I looked at Pemba. His eyes were wide with fear. 

“Avalanche!” he screamed. “Run!”

Now the source of the sound was clear. A massive cloud appeared from the top of the mountain next to Everest, and it was coming straight at me.

353,368,10,2,"<b>Chapter 1</b>

Hi. My name is Molly. 

I am just a normal kid, like every other kid. But today is not a normal day.

Today I start Grade 2. You might be thinking, why am I so excited to start school? Well, the thing is, Grade 2 is going to be different.

This year I get to be in Mrs. Jenkin’s class. Mrs. Jenkin’s classroom is special because it has a class pet named Snoopy.

He is a guinea pig. He is black and white, and has long hair that covers his eyes. I know this because in Grade 1 I used to walk by Mrs. Jenkin’s classroom just to see Snoopy. 

I was so jealous of the Grade 2 students that got to feed and take care of Snoopy. Mrs. Jenkin’s even let the students take Snoopy home!

I love animals, but my mom and dad will not let me have a pet. I beg and beg, but they still say no. They say a pet is a lot of work, and I am too young to have that kind of responsibility.

But little did they know, I have a plan.

 

<b>Chapter 2</b>

“Molly, you are going to be late for school,” Mom yells from the kitchen.

I am almost ready, but I can’t find my favorite shoes. The sparkly silver sneakers with bright pink laces.

I bend down and look under the bed. There they are! I slip one foot inside, and then the other.

“Molly, the bus is going to be here any minute!”

Mom is getting upset now. I better hurry. The problem is that I just learned how to tie my shoes over the summer.

I take both laces in my hands and think carefully.

“Over, under, pull it tight,” I think in my head. “Make a bow and pull it through to do it right.” 

Got it!

I do the same with the other shoe, and run downstairs.

Jack is sitting at the kitchen table. He is my little brother. He’s not big enough to go to real school yet. He goes to preschool a few days a week. Mom says it will get him ready for big kid school.

“Molly, hurry up and eat some breakfast,” Mom says.

I sit next to my brother, and look down at my plate. Waffles! My favourite.

“Thanks, Mom,” I say.

Mom gives me a smile as she wipes my brother’s face with a napkin.

I eat my breakfast quickly, and run to the door.

Mom is already there with my backpack in her hand. “Have a great first day of Grade 2. I can’t wait to hear all about it.”

She helps me put on my backpack and gives me a kiss on the head.

“Bye!” I yell as I walk down the driveway.

Just as I reach the end the bus comes around the corner. Perfect timing. The bus stops at the end of our driveway. I turn around and give another wave to Mom. I step up the stairs of the bus.

“This is going to be a great year,” I think in my head.

<b>Chapter 3</b>

I find a seat near the front of the class. My friend Amy sits down at the desk next to mine.

I haven’t seen Amy all summer because she went away to soccer camp.

“Hi Molly,” she says.

“Hi Amy, how was camp?” I ask.

 “It was fun. I played soccer every day and got to stay with a different family. They had a pool and everything!” she says.

“That sounds fun,” I say. I try to keep my eyes on Amy as she talks more about camp, but I can’t help but notice Snoopy’s cage.

It is on a small table beside the window near the reading corner.

I wonder to myself who will get to take Snoopy home first? It just has to be me! The sooner I take Snoopy home, the sooner Mom and Dad will see how responsible I am and let me have my very own pet.

“Molly, are you listening?” Amy asks, sounding frustrated.

“Oh sorry,” I say. “Hey do you know if Snoopy is in his cage?” 

Amy just rolls her eyes at me.

Just then Mrs. Jenkins starts to speak in front of the class. “Good morning class, and welcome to Grade 2.”
"
354,369,5,4,"Lucy and Alex had all kinds of books: 

storybooks, science books, some just for cooks.

Some smelled like dust, and others were new, 

and some had hard covers, but only a few.

 

Some books had pictures and some were without,

but neither one knew what these were about.

Because Lucy and Alex, back when they were small,

just played with their books, but read not at all.

 

They used all their books in all kinds of ways.

As sketchpads, as door-stops, and even a maze.

They piled them up and climbed way up high,

for a better view, when they wanted to spy. 

And sometimes, when monsters and ghosts would come near,

they built a strong fort, so they’d sleep without fear.

 

One day, their mother came into their room. 

She glanced all around and she started to fume.

She said, “Look at these books all over the floor!” 

“You climb them and use them as stops for the door!”

“You use them for warding off monsters in bed,

but oh, how I wish you would <i>read</i> them instead!”

 

But Lucy and Alex said impatiently,

“We need them for crossing this moat! Don’t you see?” 

“The carpet is water, this book is a rock,

and only from one to the next can we walk.”

 

Their mother just sighed and nodded her head,

then spoke to them softly, and here’s what she said:

“The reading fairy will think it’s too bad.

When children don’t read, she gets very sad.”

 

Lucy and Alex then stopped suddenly,

and asked who this reading fairy might be.

“The reading fairy,” their mother began,

looks after the books in all of the lands.”

 

“She’s read every story, and knows them by heart, 

the first word, the last word, and each little part.” 

“She treasures her books, and loves nothing more, 

than sharing her gifts with the kids she adores.” 



“But when children don’t read, and their books are for play, 

then she becomes sad and starts fading away.”

That night, in their dreams, the fairy came down,

and whisked them away in her silvery gown. 

 

She showed them the places where readers can go, 

and magical spells that only <i>they</i> know.

They visited castles with dragons and moats…

They searched for lost treasure with pirates on boats...

 

They visited space and sat on the moon....

They visited jungles with bears and baboons…

They visited sweet shops with cakes and ice creams…

And places that only existed in dreams…

 

The fairy explained that these worlds live in books. 

They’re inside the covers, if only you look.

And when they awoke in their beds the next day, 

they wished to go back to those worlds right away. 

 

So Lucy and Alex did just as she said. 

They ran to their books and they read, and they read.

When their mother woke up, to her shock and delight, 

she saw in their room an unusual sight.

 

Lucy and Alex were reading away, 

not throwing, not climbing - at least for today.

And the reading fairy was glad in her heart, 

and thought to herself, “Well, it’s good a start.”
"
355,370,10,2,"My name is Holly. It is a hot summer day. My family is going to the beach.

When we get to the beach we eat lunch. I eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. My little brother, James, eats gross baby food. My mom and dad eat gross adult food. I eat my sandwich fast because I want to go play.

When I am done eating I take out my shovels and buckets. I have three shovels and two buckets. My red bucket is for making towers. My blue bucket is round. My shovels are all different sizes.

It is time to build the sandcastle. The first thing I have to do is make a big pile of sand. At first it is easy to dig. The sand is not heavy. I dig deeper. The sand is getting heavier. Now it is not so easy to dig.

My pile of sand is huge now. It is taller than James. Now it is time to start carving my sandcastle.

I push on the pile of sand with both hands to make it stronger. Then I fill my red bucket with sand, and dump it upside down on the pile. This is how I make the towers. When I slowly take off the bucket, there is a tower. I make three more towers.

I use my smallest shovel to make windows in the towers. I use my medium shovel to make doors in the towers. I use my biggest shovel to make the towers stronger.

Now it is time to dig a moat. A moat is a hole all the way around the castle that you fill with water. At first it is easy to dig. The sand is not heavy. I dig deeper. The sand is getting heavier. Now it is not so easy to dig.

I use all the extra sand I dig up to make a wall around the castle. It is time to fill the moat with water. I walk down to the ocean, and fill my blue bucket with water. James tries to follow me and my dad picks him up.

The bucket is too heavy to carry so I dump some water out. It is hard to walk, but I make it back to the sandcastle. I dump the water in the moat. It barely fills any of the moat. This is going to take a lot of trips to the ocean.

I go back and forth many times. Finally, the water is starting to fill the moat. After many more trips, the moat is finally full! I am so tired that I lay down in the sand and close my eyes.

I hear my mom yelling, but it is too late. The sandcastle is destroyed. It was destroyed by a monster. A monster named James. A two-year-old sandcastle monster.

The towers are ruined. The wall is ruined. The moat is ruined.

I am so mad. I am ready to cry. Then James comes over, gives me a big hug, and says “sorry”.

I cannot be mad at James. I hug him back and tell him it is okay. I still love him, even if he <i>is</i> a sandcastle monster.

356,371,5,2,"There once was a place,

in a far away land.

A wonderful space,

where nothing was bland.



The trees were all tall,

and the leaves were all green.

The lakes were so deep,

and everything was clean.



This place was called Arno,

as you’ll soon come to know.



Away from Arno,

was a boy named Jon.

He dreamed of Arno,

each night as he yawned.



As he would drift,

deep deep into sleep,

he’d picture the trip

to lakes so deep.



He longed for Arno,

a place you’ll soon come to know.



Each day Jon would wake,

as the sun shined in beams.

He would draw and create,

pictures of his dreams.



He drew all the lakes,

all the forest and hills.

The rabbits, the snakes,

and the porcupine’s quills.



He longed for Arno,

a place we promise, you’ll soon come to know.



Jon always went to school,

and sat in his class.

He would follow each rule,

and each test he would pass.



The teacher had them write,

stories in their book.

Jon’s mind would take flight,

with each turn his tale took. 



He wrote of Arno,

a place we still promise, you’ll soon come to know.



That day as Jon walked,

all the way home.

He found himself shocked,

at the sight of a gnome!



A wee person so small,

that Jon could barely see.

A gnome that was not tall,

but sang as loud as three!



The gnome was from Arno,

a place you’ll soon come to know.



""Who are you?”

asked Jon, quite shocked.

""I am Rilo, it’s true!”

The gnome danced as he talked.



""Where do you come from?”

asked Jon, still afraid.

""An island known only to some,”

Rilo said as he played. 



The island of Arno,

a place you’ll very soon come to know.



""Where is Arno found?”

asked Jon, still unsure.

""The end of the long way around,”

Rilo yelled from the floor.



""That’s not a way to a place,”

said Jon quite annoyed.

A smile appeared on Rilo’s face,

as with Jon the gnome toyed.



""Follow me to Arno… 

a place you are now about to know”.



""We’ll be back in a flash,”

said Rilo the wee gnome.

""Unless we should crash,

I’ll bring you back home”.



""Crash what?” asked Jon,

as he chased to catch up.

Rilo skipped along,

singing back, ""The flying teacup.”



""The flying teacup will take us to Arno,

a place you’ll soon come to know.”



Jon ran home very fast.

Would his parents say yes?

A great trip at last,

to the place he’d soon like best.



They opened the door,

and both said ""Hello”.

Down went Jon’s mother,

fainting at first sight of Rilo.



""Wake up- we are going to Arno,

a place we’ll all soon get to know”.



They all climbed aboard

the bright colored cup.

Away they soared,

Rilo, Jon, and his parents and pup.



""This cup has magic powers,”

Rilo said as they started to spin.

Jon’s eyes fell on flowers,

lakes, and Rilo’s sly grin.



""We’ve arrived in Arno, 

the secret to which you’ll soon know!”



Wide-eyed and amazed,

Jon looked every which way.

""It’s not possible,” quite dazed,

he heard his parents say!



""Anything can be true,”

said Rilo quite proud.

""Beauty comes from the things that you do,”

he smiled, calling aloud.



""We’ve arrived in Arno, 

the secret to which, we promise you’ll soon know!”



""What do you mean,

by the things that you do?”

With the beauty he’d seen,

how were these words true?



""You’ll soon wake up!

This is all just a dream.

The tea cup, and Arno,

are not quite what they seem.



You’re about to learn the secret of Arno,

a secret that I hope you’ll forever know”.



The gnome waved a hand,

and came very close.

The grass turned to sand.

Jon thought he’d seen a ghost.



""Arno is the earth,

the spirit of all things.

We must not hurt,

the nature from which life springs!



You’re learning the secret of Arno,

a secret that I hope you’ll forever know!



So when you wake up,

remember my words.

Remember the beauty, the tea cup,

the animals in herds.



Know that whatever you do,

your actions are strong.

That it is certainly true,

So don’t treat your earth wrong.”



""Take the knowledge of Arno and use it on Earth.

It's your only home ever. Nothing could have more worth!""

357,372,10,3,"There once was a man with little old feet,

Who came every day to the park down the street.

 

He sat on the bench with his small bag of seed,

And all of the little birds there he would feed.

 

Before very long, a great many came,

And when each arrived, he called them by name.

 

The birds greeted him, as each came along,

And each sang to him, their own little song.

 

The sparrows sang higher, the ravens sang low,

And the starlings all chirped as they swooped to and fro.

 

The robins all sang their sweet melody,

And the chickadees sang, “chick-a-dee-dee-dee-dee.”

 

The old pigeons cooed with a sad kind of note,

And the mourning dove sang with a frog in her throat.

 

The geese honked away, in Canadian style,

And the little ducks quacked as they marched single file.   

 

The thrushes were merry, the cardinals proud,

And everyone thought that the seagulls were loud!

 

While they sang their tunes, the man waved his hand,

Conducting them like his own little band.

 

They ate from his palm and chirped their great thanks,

Then flew to their flock to rejoin the ranks.

 

They swooped and they soared in lovely formations,

On wings that had flown them to many far nations.

 

Watching them play on the wind like a kite,

My little mind raced with joy and delight.

 

They seemed so at ease and, though it’s absurd,

I thought to myself, “...wish I was a bird.”

 

The days became cool and the trees became bare, 

And one day that man in the park wasn’t there.

 

I ran to his bench and looked all around,

But the little old man was not to be found.

 

I went to my to mother with tearful lament,

And asked if she knew where the little man went.

 

She held my small hand and smiled a sad smile,

And said, “it was nice that he stayed for a while.”

 

“But like his dear friends - the blue jay and bittern, 

He went with the birds and flew south for the winter.”

359,374,12,5,"Wally the llama was in search of a cake for his best friend, Roger the Rooster. It was Roger’s birthday. Wally went to Bob the Beaver’s Bakery to buy the cake. 

That cake was the most beautiful thing he had ever laid his eyes on. His mouth was watering just looking at it. He knew this was the cake to get for Roger. On the way home, Wally was tempted many times to eat Roger the Rooster’s cake. But he didn’t. He knew it was a gift for his friend.

Later that day, the party began.

When Wally showed up with the cake to the party, everyone stared at it with big smiles. Wally left the cake in the kitchen where Roger would not see it. Wally was the only one who knew where the cake was.

As the party started and games were played, Wally became very hungry. His hunger made him think of how good the cake had looked in the bakery. Wally left the games and snuck into the kitchen.

The cake sat there looking simply amazing. Suddenly, he could not stop himself any more! Wally dove face first into the cake.

Before he knew it, the cake was gone, and icing was all over his face. As he turned around, there was Roger the Rooster with tears rolling down his eyes. Wally knew he had made Roger very sad. Roger left the kitchen, went to his room, and locked the door.

Wally felt bad. He knew he had to find something to make this up to Roger. He went to Paddy the Panda’s Pastry Shop to find an even better cake.  He spent all the money he had on a cake that was 10 times as big as the first! 

It had sparklers all around the bottom, fireworks poking out the top, gummy bears stuck to every inch, chocolate icing on the outside, ice cream on the inside, AND a message written in gumballs that said “Happy Birthday Roger!”.

Wally carefully ran back to the party with the cake and put it on the table. He got the others to light it and then knocked on Roger’s door. Roger opened his door and saw the best cake he had ever seen in his life! It was taller than the fridge! It was wider than the couch! Wally and their friends sang “Happy Birthday” to Roger and it put a big smile back on his face.

Wally told Roger that he was sorry for eating the first cake. They hugged. 

Wally learned that he should treat others how he would like to be treated. Wally and Roger have been best friends ever since. They always put each others feelings first, <i>even</i> when there’s cake around.

362,377,11,5,"Neil stepped into the central hub of the spaceship. It didn’t look the way that he had imagined it from all the movies and his comics. He had expected it to be filled with thousands of tiny flashing lights, and shining multicolored buttons. He had thought there would be levers and switches and computer screens showing complicated radar readings. But there was none of that. 

Instead the hub was very small, and very dark. The walls were all curved and the ceiling was low. It made him feel like he was inside a bird’s egg. Strangest of all, there were no windows in this room. How was he supposed to see out, let alone steer the ship? 

He took another step into the room, though it was difficult to see. His footsteps were muffled by thick carpeting that covered every inch of the floor, walls, and ceiling. In fact, as he moved he made no sound at all. Now that Neil noticed it, the room was so silent that it was almost like sound was being sucked out of it completely. That thought sent a cold shiver up the back of his neck.

His eyes finally adjusted enough to the dark to notice a chair stationed in front of him. He walked around to the front and sat down. A strange tingling sensation ran up his legs and down his arms. He blinked, and for the split second his eyes were closed he saw something– a flash of light! He closed his eyes again. 

He was looking out from the front end of the ship. He could see the infinite expanse of blackness and stars beyond. But he wasn’t looking out a window of the ship at this view. He <i>was</i> the ship. 

As that surreal realization settled into place, a small voice chimed inside his head.

""Prepare to launch?”

363,378,12,4,"Have you ever read a beautiful story about bear puke and dynamite? No? Well then get yourself ready, because that’s exactly what this is. Beautiful stories about bear puke and dynamite used to be very popular. Now, sadly, they are quite rare. It’s funny the way trends come and go. But now is not the time to think of the old days– there is a story to be told. And a very beautiful one at that.

Once, a long long time ago, there was a cave. Inside that very cave, there was a bear. And that bear is the vomiting hero of our story– but not quite yet. You see, the bear was in the cave for a strange and sad reason. The bear had wandered far from its home lands. He had become separated from his mother in the woods, and then had gotten lost. And on top of everything else, now he was being hunted (by a hunter). So, in an attempt to lose the hunter, the bear hid inside that cave.

The bear sat very still and silent, but soon the hunter approached. He couldn’t see the bear, but he knew he was in there. So, like the very reckless hunter he was, he came up with a very reckless plan. The hunter lit the fuse of a stick of dynamite and threw it into the cave! <i>BANG</i>! The dynamite exploded in every direction! Chunks of rock flew off the cave ceiling! Everything was covered in a huge thick cloud of dust. Thinking that he would come back for the bear’s body when the dust had settled, the hunter left.

But the bear was not dead. The bear was not even hurt! What the bear was, was scared. So he puked. Then, shaken, but happy to have escaped, the bear left the cave too (in the other direction).

So inside that cave there lay a puddle of bear puke. And inside that bear puke was a fig that the bear had eaten back home. And inside that fig was a seed. A fig seed. So there the fig seed lay in the puddle of puke on the dirt floor of that cave.

And in the ceiling of that cave was a hole. A hole that had been blown out by the dynamite. And inside that hole there was sunlight. In fact, that little hole let a golden sunbeam right into the middle of the cave. And that sunbeam landed right in the middle of that puddle of bear puke. Right on top of the fig seed.

So years went by, and little by little, the fig seed grew. It grew and grew into a beautiful fig tree, right inside that cave! And the tree began to grow figs of its own. And every once in a while, that same bear would come by for a snack.

You see, the bear loved figs. He had eaten them all the time at home. But there were no fig trees here in this strange land. None except the one in the cave. So sometimes he came back for a nibble. But he always kept an eye out for that reckless hunter.

Then one day another bear came walking through those lands. She had walked a very long way. She was looking for her baby bear. She had walked for years and years in search of her baby. And now that mama bear was feeling very hungry. That’s when she spotted a fig tree up in the distance. She walked over to it. And as she walked, she thought how strange it was to see a fig tree in these lands. But she was happy, because they reminded her of home. 

As she sat and ate some figs, another bear approached the tree. 

Her baby! 

The two bears hugged beneath the tree. They ate as many figs as they could, and headed back home together. Neither one of them ever saw that reckless hunter again. But as they walked off through the forest, they stepped over a hunter's cap that was smoking slightly on the ground.

364,379,7,4,"“Jacinda,” her father called from down the hall. “Turn off the tablet! No more screen time. Time for bed!”

“Fine!” she called back. How did he always seem to know?

Jacinda switched off the tablet. It made its satisfying <i>chk</i> sound. She got up off the floor and plugged in the tablet to charge on her bedside table. It glowed softly for a moment, almost like a smile. Then it turned dark once more and Jacinda climbed into bed. 

Her father peeked his head in through the door. Warm yellow light streamed in behind him, turning his face into a blank black mask.

“Sweet dreams, Honeybear,” he said. “Want me to come tuck you in?”

“Abba!” Jacinda said sharply. “I’m eleven! I don’t want you to tuck me in anymore!” Even though they were alone in the room, she felt embarrassed. She could feel heat rise in her cheeks.

“Alright, Jacinda.” he said softly. “Goodnight.” He backed out of the room, closing the door and taking the light with him. 

Jacinda lay back on her pillows in the dark room. For a moment she stared up at the ceiling fan going around and around. Then she slowly let her eyelids droop, and close.

<i>Chk</i>. She heard something but didn’t open her eyes. <i>Chk chk</i>. Was that the sound of the tablet turning on? <i>Chk chk. Chk chk</i>. She let out a small sigh and turned over, finally opening her eyes. But when she looked at the tablet, it was just how she’d left it. It lay on the table, dark and still. 

“Shhhh...” she mumbled quietly, already letting her eyes close again. 

This time she was just about to drift off to sleep when something caught her attention. Her eyes were still closed, but a bright light was suddenly flooding through them. She focused on the glaring red of the insides of her eyelids for a moment. She tried to pull herself awake again. Then she opened her eyes once more. 

This time, something was different.

The tablet still lay there on her bedside table like before. But it wasn’t dark any longer. The screen had turned on, shining a blazing white light up at the ceiling. Now she had to actually get up. 

She pushed herself up on her elbows and grabbed the tablet. The light was hard on her sleepy eyes. She squinted down at it, frowning, and pushed the off switch again. 

Nothing happened. 

She pushed it a few more times, quickly becoming frustrated. 

“What is wrong with you? Stupid thing,” she growled at it. She reached for its charger. But just as her hand closed around the cord to yank it out, she stopped.

A text bubble had appeared on the bright white screen. 

“<i>I wouldn’t do that, Jacinda.</i>” it read. 

Jacinda stared down at it, her mouth hanging open. Another message appeared.

“<i>Take your hand off my charger. You don’t want to see what happens if you don’t.</i>”

Jacinda couldn’t move. She didn’t take her hand off the cord, but she didn’t pull it free either. She suddenly noticed her own heart pounding hard inside her chest. It jolted her back to life and she screamed for her parents.

But no sound came out. She could feel her mouth moving. She felt her throat stretch and strain in her neck. But she didn’t hear anything. Not a sound.

She tried again, louder this time. Still no sound.

With horror she looked down at the tablet, her eyes widening. Beneath the first two green text bubbles were two new ones. These ones were blue.

“HELP!” they read. “Help, help! Mom! Dad! Come here quick, something is wrong with the tablet! PLEASE!”

“<i>Time for a little more screen time, Jacinda.</i>”

366,381,10,4,"Tom and Jesse held on for their lives as they rushed down the river. The dense green jungle flashed by them on every side, so fast that it was little more than a blur! 

“I don’t know if I can hold on for much longer!” Jesse yelled, gripping the rubber raft handles tight.

They swerved around another sharp bend and almost hit a large rock sticking out of the river. The water’s frothy white spray came crashing over their heads, leaving them soaking wet. Tom looked up and saw two vines dangling from a low tree branch over the river’s course ahead. Looking farther downstream he saw a cluster of sharp rocks and then nothing. A drop-off. A waterfall.

“We’re going to have to grab those vines!” Tom screamed, summoning all his strength. Jesse whipped around to look where Tom was pointing.

“What are you, totally deranged?!?” he cried. “What do you think this is a movie or something? How are we supposed to–”

“JUMP!” Tom screamed, leaping into the air. The tree branch was right above them.

His fingers closed on the thick vine and he felt himself swinging through the air. His legs flailed helplessly above the roaring water. Then suddenly he saw land beneath him and let go, falling to the ground in a heap. Before he could look up to see what had happened to Jesse, something heavy landed on top of him.

“THAT WAS A TERRIBLE PLAN!” Jesse screamed, fumbling to get to his feet.

Tom smiled and got up too, wiping the dirt off of himself. “Yes it was. But we’re alive, aren’t we? Couldn’t have been too bad.”

368,383,10,4,"Grayson opened the pancake mix. He was going to try and make banana pancakes by himself for the very first time. He got all the ingredients ready then mashed them up in a bowl. Then he turned on the stove and took out a big pan. Grayson poured the mix into the pan in little circles. Soon it started to cook. 

He flipped the pancakes once. Success! Perfection!

Then his sister Jane came over. Jane started telling Grayson all about her Super Strawberry lip gloss. She waved it in front of his face and put it under his nose to sniff. But Grayson didn’t want his first ever banana pancakes to burn, so he told Jane to go away. 

“Fine!” Jane huffed, stomping away. “I’m going to have a tea party and <i>you’re</i> not invited!” She went to her room and closed the door.

Grayson checked his pancakes, but they still weren't ready yet. Suddenly his brother Ethan flew into the kitchen, attacking Grayson with a pillow. Grayson grabbed the pillow and threw it across the room. Ethan ran after it and came back laughing. 

“What are you doing?” he asked.

Grayson saw that his pancakes were finally done. “Banana pancakes,” he said. He switched off the stove and looked Ethan dead in the eye. “And you’re not having any.” Then Grayson turned back around and slid the pancakes onto a plate. 

“We’ll see about that…” Ethan mumbled. 

Grayson put the plate of pancakes down on the table. Then he walked across the room to the fridge and grabbed the maple syrup. Then he opened the drawer and pulled out a knife and fork. But when he got back to his plate, both Ethan and the plate of pancakes were gone!

Grayson looked around, but they were nowhere to be found. Just when Grayson was about to explode with anger, he heard a small laugh. <i>They must be nearby.</i>

He checked under the table, behind the couch, and even in the shower! Then he realised there was one place he had never checked. <i>The big cabinet under the sink.</i>

Grayson ran over to the cabinet. But before he got a chance to pull open the doors, Ethan burst out of it, giggling madly. Without looking back, Ethan wrenched open the front door and ran outside.

Grayson picked the empty plate up off the floor. There wasn’t even a crumb left.

375,390,10,5,"Inga was new on the street and Alexa was her new friend. The two were walking to the supermarket on an errand for Alexa’s mum with a crisp ten dollar bill. Alexa was smacking a large piece of gum as they went. Inga was telling Alexa about the house she used to live in. But then Alexa suddenly grabbed her arm and pulled her down behind a garbage can. 

“Hey, what are you–” Inga began. But Alexa held a finger over her mouth to tell her to be quiet. Then she carefully poked her head around the side.

She whispered back to Inga over her shoulder. “Come look,” she said. 

Inga crawled forward and peered out over Alexa’s head. She didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. Inga liked her new street. The houses were small and the sidewalks were cracked, but almost every single garden was exploding with flowers. Many of them had odd little stone statues of lions, or babies, or eagles too. From here Inga could see the tallest tree on the block, and the spot where Alexa had said that she broke her leg once. But all of that seemed normal.

“What are you talking about?” she whispered. “What am I supposed to be looking at?”

Alexa rolled her eyes. She jutted her finger out slightly, careful not to let it extend beyond the garbage can. Her eyes were wide and she seemed to be trying to point at something with her eyebrows. “Right. There. Her!” she mumbled through clenched teeth.

Inga looked out again where Alexa had pointed. She saw a woman about her mom’s age walking down her driveway to the sidewalk. She wore broken plastic sandals and red capris that seemed to just barely stretch across her sizeable backside. 

“Who’s that?” Inga whispered, crawling back to safety behind the garbage can.

“That’s Ms. Vesser,” Alexa replied, looking excited. “And in the entire twelve long years of my life, I’ve never EVER seen her leave her house. We’ve gotta follow her.”

382,397,2,3,"Step One: Get a rectangular piece of paper. Place it in front of you lengthwise.

 

Step Two: Fold the paper in half by bringing the left edge to meet the right edge. Press all along the fold to make a crease. You should be left with a tall, skinny rectangle.

 

Step Three: Open the paper back up again. There should be a crease running from top to bottom through the middle of the sheet.

 

Step Four: Fold the top left corner in towards the middle. One of its edges should line up with the middle crease. Press on the fold to make a crease. Repeat this step with the top right corner.

 

Step Five: Take the left edge of the sheet. Fold it so that the top half lines up with the center crease. Press along the fold to make a crease. Repeat this step with the right edge of the sheet. Your sheet should now be flat on the bottom, with a pointed top and two slanted sides.

 

Step Six: Take the left side of the sheet. Bring it to meet the right side, folding along the center crease. You should be left with a tall skinny rectangle.

 

Step Seven: Take the slanted edge of the rectangle. Fold it to meet the long, straight edge of the rectangle. Press on the fold to make a crease all the way down to the point. This will make a wing! Flip your paper over and repeat this step on the other side.

Step One: Choose a site. It’s good to start with a site where you know people have been living for a long, long time. Better chances that you’ll find something good!

 

Step Two: Separate the site. It’s important to keep discoveries organized. To do this, sites are split up into grids and squares. That way you’ll know exactly where an item was found.

 

Step Three: Start digging! Grab a shovel or a pick and get dirty!

 

Step Four: Brush carefully. Once you think you’ve found something, slow down. Old artifacts can break very easily. Switch the shovel for a brush and uncover the item carefully.

 

Step Five: Store and record findings. Take pictures! Take measurements! Take notes! Gather as much data as possible from your discoveries. Then make sure to store them safely for future study.

 

Step Six: Study them at home/ the lab. Scientists can run tests to find out just how old your discovery is. The work of other experts might help uncover the mysteries of what you found. And your findings might help uncover some of their mysteries too!

 

Step Seven: Repeat! There is always more out there to learn and discover!

But the Haudenosaunee (pronounced Haw-den-oh-saw-nee) League of Nations came much earlier than that. It was one of the first confederacies in North America! Historians trace its beginnings all the way back to 1450– or even 1142! The League brought six indigenous tribes together. The League was led by 50 chiefs called the Grand Council. Each chief represented a clan within one of the tribes. Together they traded and protected each other. They were also known as the Iroquois (pronounced Ear-oh-kwah) League of Nations, or the Six Nations.

391,406,4,5,"Ayanna swam farther and farther out into the dark, deep lake. At this time of night, the water was pitch black and very still. It looked like the sky’s very own hand-mirror, reflecting the sparkling stars above. 

The day had been hot and the water was still warm. In fact, it was almost the exact temperature of Ayanna’s own skin. She felt almost like her body was floating through nothingness. A single loon called out from the surrounding trees. The sound echoed across the water.

Ayanna glided closer to the lake’s center. She thought about how terrible the day had been. She thought about how glad she was to be away from it all now, to be alone. She listened to the gentle sound of droplets falling from her fingertips back into the smooth water. 

Then she saw something bright bobbing towards her. She swam toward it and stopped, treading water. It was so bright that she had to squint to see its shape. It was a huge diamond! Looking around she suddenly noticed several others floating nearby. They were so beautiful, shimmering and winking in the blackness. They almost looked like stars fallen to Earth, Ayanna thought.

It was that very thought that made her look up. And what she saw there took her breath away. High above her she saw, not the sky, but the shore she had just left. She saw the tops of pointed green trees and the rocky bank of the lake. She saw the shining surface of the lake itself! She saw it all as though from high above. But how could that possibly be?

<i>You already know the answer</i>, a small voice said inside Ayanna’s head. And somehow, though it seemed crazy, she did. “I’m...in the sky,” she whispered aloud. <i>And you have to find out what lies on the opposite shore.</i>

395,410,9,5,"The first sightings of the Mothman were reported in 1966. Five men in a graveyard spotted the creature. They described a flying man with huge gray wings, and glowing red eyes. 
"
396,411,9,5,"Have you ever wondered how fish stay warm in some of those frozen northern lakes? How about a nice fur coat? That seems to be the thinking behind the legend of the furry trout! Though never proven to exist, fur-covered fish have been popular in myth. Tales of these critters have popped up in North America and Iceland. Some of them date as far back as the 17th century. Most legends claim that cold water forced these fish to develop their thick, shaggy fur. But others trace the origins of these furry fish to some hair tonic that fell into a river! 
"
397,412,3,5,"In America, men had the right to vote for a long time before women did. It was against the law for women to vote until 1920! Before 1920, the women who fought for their right to vote were called “suffragists.” Suffragists led many marches and protests to try and change the law. All different kinds of women were inspired to join the suffragist movement. And yet, many African-American women were banned from suffragist groups and events. At the time, African-Americans were denied many rights that white Americans enjoyed. Many white Americans did not want African-Americans to be equal members of society. White suffragists worried that welcoming African-American women would hurt their own chances of winning the vote. So African-American women were doubly excluded: both for the color of their skin, and their gender. Even so, amazing African-American women like Sojourner Truth and Mary Church Terrell fought on. Their work and courage led the way for many rights that all Americans enjoy today.

398,413,12,6,"Polly was quiet for a long time after that. People came to hear her speak but she did not say a single thing. She just sat in her cage thinking, and thinking, and thinking some more. She was reflecting on her own opinions, which she had never really given much careful thought to before. Did she really want a cracker? Did she even actually like crackers? She suddenly had the overwhelming desire to decide for herself.

After a while, she slowly began speaking again. She didn’t say as much as she used to, but now all her words were her very own. Polly the Parrot was an absolute original. Polly the Parrot was not a copycat anymore!
"
399,414,2,5,"Vertebrates are animals with backbones. All the vertebrates in the world can be split into five smaller groups. Mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, and amphibians. But what do these groups mean? The animals in these groups have some things in common, and some differences. Mammals are warm-blooded animals with hair or fur. They give birth to live young (not eggs), and nurse their babies with milk. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with dry skin and scales. They usually lay eggs. Birds are warm-blooded animals with wings and feathers. They always lay eggs! Fish are cold-blooded animals with fins and scales. They can breathe underwater using gills, and they also lay eggs. Amphibians are cold-blooded animals with moist skin and webbed feet. They live on land and in water, and lay eggs too!

400,415,8,3,"Luka sat in the big airplane seat. He inhaled the stale air. He pulled on his metal seat belt tab. <i>Click-click</i>. He reached up and pressed a button on the ceiling. The light above him flicked on and off. He swung his legs back and forth. His toes thudded against the seat in front of him. The snooty woman sitting there turned around to give him a mean look. He stopped swinging his feet. The snooty woman turned back around. 

But Luka still felt someone’s eyes on him. He looked across the aisle. A few rows up was a man in a hat. The hat was pulled low. His jacket collar was pulled up high. All Luka could see was his shining eyes peeping out at him. But as Luka looked, the man quickly faced forward once more. Luka kept watching him but the man didn’t turn around again. He was staring at the pages of a newspaper in his hands. Every few minutes he turned the page. But Luka didn’t think the man was really reading the paper. He was holding it upside down.
"
401,416,7,6,"Kieran was sitting far too close to the dark television set. His hands and nose were pressed up against the glass, trying to get his eyes close enough to confirm what he had seen. The screen was black, but restless. A shifting dark static was buzzing over every available inch of its surface. But Kieran could swear he had just seen an actual shape among all that noise and chaos. He had seen a creature inside the screen itself. It had come and gone so quickly that he couldn’t say for sure what it had been. It had seemed to be made up of that crawling, roiling, blackness too. And it had seemed to slither. Kieran watched and waited. It wasn't a cartoon or a television program, of that he was absolutely certain. 

<i>There! </i>

He caught a glimpse of it once more, its tail whipping ferociously from side to side. It was slithering through the static, closer and closer. It was a humongous serpent! Kieran leaned away from the screen but didn’t dare take his eyes off it, even to blink. The snake was as thick as a sewer pipe and longer than he could see. It drew nearer and nearer and Kieran watched it unhinge its massive jaw, revealing rows of razor-sharp fangs. Suddenly it reared up and bolted forward and the TV screen bulged out at Kieran.
"
402,417,7,6,"Selena giggled breathlessly to herself, trying to keep quiet. Her friends would never find her hiding place– at least, not until she wanted to be found. She was going to give them the Halloween thrill of their lives! And it served them right for dragging her out to this idiotic cemetery instead of going to Casey’s party like she'd wanted. She reached up to scratch her nose and a trickle of dirt fell onto her cheek. 

Lying in the bottom of a grave wasn’t nearly as bad as she’d thought it would be. It was actually almost cozy. The tall dark walls of dirt stretched out high above her, framing the starry night sky. Suddenly she could hear voices calling her name in the distance, getting closer. This was her chance! Selena scrambled to her feet– but an icy cold hand closed tight over her ankle. 
"
403,418,4,6,"Naito leapt gracefully from toadstool to toadstool. The giant glowing mushrooms wiggled and wobbled beneath her weight. Delicate clouds of vivid yellow spore rose around her ankles with every step. The bright caps shone through the darkness of the Great Forest like a row of torches lighting the way: electric blue, violet, lime. She knew she had to reach her destination quickly. And she knew she mustn’t stray from the light of the stools. Even the smallest detour into the waiting darkness could mean trouble. So Naito ran and jumped, feeling excited and terrified all at once.
"
404,419,7,5,"The coffin rattled again, and this time it didn’t stop.

Ed stared at it in horror. His eyes were wide and his hands were balled into tight sweaty fists at his sides. The coffin shook furiously, causing the dark wooden table beneath it to creak and groan. The tall pale flowers in vases on either end of it swayed and trembled. A wild pounding was coming from within the glossy black box, harder and harder until the sides began to shudder. Though the lid had been locked tight, it was starting to lift, inch by inch. A strange green light was leaking out through that gap under the lid. It was the light that scared Ed most of all. Years later when he lay down to sleep, he could still see it shining behind his eyelids. 
"
405,420,12,4,"Far below the shining stars and puffy clouds, beneath the stretching sky and shore, deep, deep in the dark, dark sea, there was a fish. The fish was flabby, and floppy, and lumpy, and it was crying. No, the fish was absolutely wailing. His name was Bob. Bob, the sobbing blobfish. 

Then, with one great throbbing sob (and a sound rather like that of a hog), Bob blew out a thick snot glob. 
"
406,421,9,4,"You've probably heard of the Scottish sea monster, Nessie. But have you ever heard of the AMERICAN sea monster, Chessie? Chessie is a mythical sea snake. She is said to live off the east coast of the United States. Like Nessie, Chessie's name comes from a body of water. Chessie has most often been spotted in Chesapeake Bay– so they call her ""Chessie""! The first reported sighting was in 1936. The stories say Chessie is 40 feet long. She is reported to be dark brown or black in color. Reports describe the shape of her head as like a horse’s, or a football.
"
407,422,9,5,"Lutins are creatures from French-Canadian myth. Lutins are small beings similar to elves and goblins. Lutins may appear in their true form, or in the form of an animal. All-white cats are often thought to be lutins in disguise. Lutins like to live near human homes. Good lutins will provide beautiful weather, or shave a man’s stubble while he sleeps! But mischievous lutins will put rocks in your shoes or dull all your knives. It is said that lutins hate salt. They will do almost anything to avoid crossing it. So if you want to keep out lutins, you better salt your driveway!
"
408,423,3,4,"Paper was invented in China over 2000 years ago. But it was the Japanese who invented the art of paper folding: origami! Paper came to Japan around 610 CE. After a while, the Japanese began folding it into beautiful shapes. At first, paper was very costly. This meant that only wealthy people could make origami. Even then it was only made for special events. At weddings, origami butterflies represented the bride and groom. Warriors traded gifts of paper folded into symbols of good luck. As time went on, paper became less costly. This meant that origami was for everyone. Just like today!
"
409,424,4,6,"The moat was alive with horrible movement. Large, scaly crocodiles snapped their jaws viciously. The water boiled and bubbled with a flesh-melting heat. Electric charges flashed sharply across its writhing surface. 

But Umberto had to get across. Looking back over his shoulder he saw the riders thundering towards him. Across the moat the drawbridge stood fast against the castle wall, secure from unwanted intruders. Just above it was an empty guard’s lookout. But how could he get up there? He looked down at his discarded lance feeling panic rise in his throat. Then he had an idea. 
"
410,425,5,6,"Nicolas sprinted through the dark and tangled brambles after the bird. The sheen of its black wings was the only thing separating it from the shadowy canopy of trees overhead. It darted quickly through the reaching branches, but Nicolas watched it sharply. He was so focused on keeping the bird in his sight as he ran that he didn’t notice a root sticking up at his feet. It caught the toe of his boot as he passed and he went tumbling through the crooked trees. 

After a moment, he got to his feet. He looked all around him but nothing looked familiar. The bird was gone. The forest was silent. Nicolas was lost.
"
411,426,6,6,"Arthur felt like he was moving through a dream. How could it be that his feet were firmly on the ground, yet he was gliding through the air 10 meters above the Paris streets? His sister Pauline had been absolutely right: The year 1900 was going to be full of marvels people could have hardly imagined! Even in his excitement to come from the village to see the World’s Fair, he never expected this. They were standing on an elevated sidewalk, high above the roads and shops. And even more amazing than that was that the sidewalk moved! It rumbled slowly around and around the exhibition grounds like a great wooden snake eating its own tail. People stepped on and off to see the attractions. But Arthur didn’t ever want to get off. He could see everything he wanted from right here on the flying serpent’s back.
"
412,427,9,6,"The golem is a creature from Jewish myth and folklore. A golem is a large, human-like creature made from mud or clay. It is said that golems can only be created by those close to God, like rabbis. A golem’s body is formed by molding inanimate materials. But a golem is brought to life by carving certain sacred Hebrew letters into its forehead. Other stories say that these letters must be inserted into the golem’s mouth. Once the golem is alive, it will do whatever its creator asks. Some legends tell of golems that became too large and dangerous. Luckily, if the sacred letters are removed from the golem, it crumbles back into dust.

413,428,11,6,"The great silver ship floated smoothly through the inky blackness. The silence in space was absolute. It made everything outside the ship seem even more still and calm. But the spaceship was gliding onward. Its large cylindrical thrusters were not engaged. Instead, three gigantic arched sails were propelling it forwards. They billowed gracefully. But it could not be wind that filled them, for there is no air in space. No, the ship's sails were filled not by wind, but by light. Dazzling light from billions of stars scattered through the nothingness. Their light shone bright enough to guide the ship to its endless fated destinations. 
"
414,429,8,3,"Lara looked at the two dogs. They were both panting. They were both shaggy. They were both brown with white spots. But one of these dogs had swallowed a priceless diamond ring. And the other one had been nothing more than a decoy. How was Lara supposed to figure out the difference? She could wait for the ring to...pass. Or, she could get to the bottom of who had planned this robbery in the first place. She looked down at the dogs. She thought the second option sounded better. 
"
415,430,6,3,"Esme stood on the grass and looked up at the hot air balloon. It was tied firmly with rope to some posts in the ground. Its gigantic round sail was striped tangerine and royal blue. Right now it was on the ground, but behind it she saw its fellows in the air. 

Esme was feeling a lot of things. She felt very scared. She didn’t like heights at all. And who was to say these new balloon things could be trusted? But she also felt ashamed of her fear. She wanted to be brave like Martha. She couldn’t be the only one to chicken out.
"
416,431,9,3,"Midas was a king in ancient Greece. He loved three things more than anything else: his young daughter, his rose garden, and gold. One day a stranger came to his palace. The stranger was half man and half goat. The stranger also seemed hungry and sick. King Midas was a kind man. He gave the stranger food and a bed. The next day the stranger awoke feeling much better. As it turned out, the stranger was special. The stranger was the friend of a powerful god. So he granted King Midas one wish for his kindness. King Midas wished that everything he touched would turn to gold. And so it did. But it was not the blessing he’d wanted. All his food turned to gold in his mouth. His roses turned to gold and fell from their bushes. Then one day his daughter ran into his arms. She turned to gold in an instant. King Midas cried. He cursed and he cried. He asked the stranger to turn back his wish. He would do anything to have his daughter back. So the stranger did it. And King Midas learned there are things much more valuable than gold.
"
417,432,3,3,"Humans didn’t invent fire. But it did take us a while to learn how to use it! That was over a million years ago. Back then, it was hard to be an early human. The darkness of night was only lit by the moon and stars. People were attacked by large animals and insects. But then, humans discovered fire! Fire helped them heat and light their caves. Fire scared away big animals and insects. Fire let them cook their food for the very first time! It changed their entire lives. Imagine how they would have felt about laptops!
"
418,433,2,3,"All plants and animals adapt to where they live. “Adapt” means ""to change."" Living things can adapt in many ways. They can change way they look, eat, or act! In hot places, some animals hunt at night. That way they beat the heat! In cold places, some animals sleep all winter. That way they stay toasty warm. In dry places, plants learn to soak up every tiny drop of water. In snowy places, tree branches slope down so the heavy snow slides off. Just like the roof of a house! All of these are adaptations!

419,434,12,6,"Mr. Munster, an extremely serious mouse, sat in his kitchen reading the paper. His oldest daughter entered the room.

“Gouda morning,” Mr. Munster said to her. “Did you sleep well last night, Mozzarella?”

Mozzarella sat down beside him. “I certainly slept feta than Gorgonzola did,” she answered with a delicate yawn. 

Just then Gorgonzola, Mr. Munster’s younger daughter, joined them at the table looking weary. “I stilton haven’t been able to get a good night’s rest!” she said. “I’ve tried everything Monterey Jack told me to do, but still I toss and turn. But I guess things could always brie worse.”

420,435,12,4,"The snowy owl perched on a bare branch. Her thick white feathers disappeared amid the falling snow. All that could be seen between fluttering flakes were her round golden eyes. She was watching. Waiting. All was silent in the forest and fields. But the snowy owl knew that with patience, her moment would come.
"
421,436,6,5,"Iona lifted the javelin. She squinted up at the sun, and threw her shoulder forward, hard. The long heavy stick soared upwards through the air like an enormous arrow. As she watched, it reached the peak of its flight and turned back towards the earth. With a whoosh and a loud clatter, the javelin landed in the dust several paces away. It had been her best toss yet but it still wasn’t good enough. She picked a pebble out of her leather sandal. She heard her mother’s words in her head: <i>A Spartan woman doesn’t try her best. A Spartan woman makes all others tremble by the strength of her will. </i>
"
422,437,4,4,"Guartha glided easily through the dark, murky waters. His powerful scaly tail swished back and forth, leaving small whirlpools behind him. The little light that reached this place was green and muted. This was a lifeless land. Nothing dwelt here. Nothing but pebbles, vast space, and darkness. Guartha moved quickly through it towards the tall canyon wall. 

Its smooth slate face rose up for miles above him, beyond sight. Right down the middle was a narrow, craggy opening. All looked pitch black within it. But Guartha knew where it led. Barely wide enough for his slender form, he squeezed through it. He swam for a long time through the darkness. He took care not to scrape against the rough rock sides. Finally he came to the opening on the other end. His eyes were greeted by the familiar sight: a riot of color and motion. 
"
423,438,5,5,"Once upon a time there was a house on a normal street. The street was normal, but the house certainly was not. For one thing, in the house’s front yard stood the tallest tree on the block. And it wasn’t tallest by just a little bit, but by a whole lot. It was a blue spruce tree over 50 feet tall! (It seemed to grow a bit more everyday). Most of the other front yards on the block didn’t have trees at all. For another thing, the house was painted all kinds of crazy colors. The porch was clear sky blue and the brick was sunshine yellow, with apricot trim around the windows. Most of the other houses on the block were only painted one boring color (like beige). Last of all (and maybe oddest too), the house had a great spangled snake nailed to its porch railing. The snake was painted wood covered in strange small bits of junk that glinted in the sun. It stretched almost all the way around the porch and seemed to consider people as they walked by.

None of the neighbors liked that house at all.
"
424,439,12,5,"The boy and the girl stepped cautiously toward one another. The tall grass all around them leaned and swayed dazedly. The girl looked the boy up and down. She saw the smudges on his face and the ramshackle state of his clothes. She took a hesitant step to her left. The boy matched her exactly, taking one step to his left in kind. The boy looked the girl up and down. He took in the leaves in her hair and the noteworthy absence of shoes. He took another step to the left, and the girl followed suit. Then they were circling each other, their eyes locked, slowly carving a ring in the field. Until all of a sudden they both stopped in their tracks, standing directly opposite one another. The girl reached out her right hand and the boy reached out his. Then they shook.

425,440,9,4,"The Titans are some of the oldest gods in Greek myth. Many of the Titans were the children of Gaia (said like <i>guy-uh</i>) and Uranus (said like <i>yur-ay-nuss</i>). Gaia was the goddess of the Earth. Uranus was the god of the sky. The two had many powerful children together. But three of their children came out as awful monsters! Each of them was said to have fifty heads and a hundred hands. When they were born, Uranus was horrified! He thought they were so ugly that he tried to put them back in Gaia’s womb! But, in time, those three became bigger and stronger than any of their siblings.

426,441,6,4,"Bernard sat behind his father’s desk. He had to clamber up onto his knees to see over the top. As he moved, the polished leather of the chair squeaked. Bernard froze, listening for anyone that may have heard him. There was nothing. He looked down at the desk. It was so wide he could not have reached a hand to both ends at once. The wood was dark and shiny. Papers lay in short neat stacks across its surface. He peered down at the one closest to him. It was a telegram– from France! From his mother! Bernard read it hungrily: <i>You are dreaming Alfred STOP Flight is for birds not people STOP why don’t you come back down to Earth with us and never mind the inventions FINAL STOP. </i>
"
427,442,11,4,"Zorra stared out from behind the red screens of the giant robot’s eyes. Far below her she saw people fleeing in every direction. Small children and grandmas struggled through the crowd. Men and women looked back with terror in their faces. Cats and dogs streaked down alleys and under fences. 

She took her hand off the joystick. The robot stopped walking with a booming <i>CLANK</i>. Maybe things had gone too far. 
"
428,443,8,6,"Was it just Kyler’s overactive imagination, or was everything in his locker more disheveled than how he had left it? He was no neat-freak, that was for sure, but he did know his own mess pretty well. This seemed different. Everything was in a slightly different place than before. His gym socks were no longer inside out. His old candy wrappers were scattered in a different arrangement. The mysterious goo that had been oozing over his old textbooks was now smeared across the door as well. Somebody had been going through his stuff, alright. But who? And why?

429,444,9,5,"The legend of the Sack Man is told in many countries all over the world. The Sack Man wanders through cities and towns filling his sack with naughty children. Some versions of the tale say that he eats them. Others say he sells them off. Some stories claim he is a magical being or even a demon. But still others report that he is merely a human man who made a deal with the parents of misbehaving children.  Either way, parents across the world all tell their kids the same thing: Play nice and do as we say or the Sack Man will get you!
"
430,445,8,5,"“You have to believe me!” Ramone cried. “I’m being framed! I wasn’t involved in any of this– I swear!”

“And why should we agree to simply take your almighty word for it, Mr. Ramirez?” Principal Manhammer replied, speaking in dangerously soft tones across his desk. His fingertips were pressed together, almost covering the satisfied smirk on his lips. “You have been in and out of detention almost every single week this month. It seems to me that you don’t find anything problematic about breaking our rules.”

“But I didn’t do it! Not this!” Ramone tried to gather his composure. “Listen, in the past I may have...bent...a few rules, but I’ve never denied it. Lying isn't really so much my thing, you know? Now, I’m telling you I had absolutely nothing to do with this. Someone is obviously setting me up.”

Manhammer smiled even wider. ""What a convenient little story that would be, Ramirez. Too bad for you that liars and rule-breakers are all the same in my book– and my book's the only one that counts just now.""
"
431,446,12,5,"One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.

""Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples. This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.

""It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; ""she has no money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds. Then, when the autumn came they all flew away. 
"
432,447,12,4,"""One red rose is all I want,” cried the Nightingale, ""only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?”

""There is a way,” answered the Tree; ""but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you.”

""Tell it to me,” said the Nightingale, ""I am not afraid.”

""If you want a red rose,” said the Tree, ""you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart’s-blood. You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn. All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.” 
"
433,448,5,6,"Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep. The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. “Spring has forgotten this garden,” they cried, “so we will live here all the year round.” The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver.

434,449,12,3,"""I can hop right down and get it and then hop right up again,"" thought Chatterer.

""Don't do it,"" said the small voice inside. ""Corn is plenty good enough. Besides, it is time you were getting back to the Old Orchard.""

""It won't take but a minute,"" said Chatterer, ""and I really must know what that tastes like.""

With that he jumped down. Snap! Chatterer looked up. The little wire door had closed. Old Mr. Trouble had got Chatterer at last. Yes, Sir, he certainly had got Chatterer this time. You see, he couldn't open that little wire door from the inside. He was in a trap—the wire rat-trap set by Farmer Brown's boy.
"
435,450,12,5,"""Perhaps Shadow the Weasel has caught him, after all,"" thought Sammy, and straightway flew to a certain place in the Green Forest where he might find Shadow the Weasel. Sure enough, Shadow was there. Now of course it wouldn't do to ask right out if Shadow had caught Chatterer, and Sammy was smart enough to know it.

""Chatterer the Red Squirrel sends his respects and hopes you are enjoying your hunt for him,"" called Sammy.

Shadow looked up at Sammy, and anger blazed in his little, red eyes. ""You tell Chatterer that I'll get him yet!"" snarled Shadow.

Sammy's eyes sparkled with mischief. He had made Shadow angry, and he had found out what he wanted to know. He was sure that Shadow had not caught Chatterer.
"
436,451,12,3,"""Good afternoon, Prickly Porky. Have you heard the news about Chatterer?"" said Peter, talking very fast, for he was quite out of breath.



""Yes,"" replied Prickly Porky. ""Serves him right. I hope it will teach him a lesson.""



Peter's heart sank. ""Don't you think it is dreadful?"" he asked. ""Just think, he will never, never be able to run and play in the Green Forest again, unless we can get him out.""



""So much the better,"" grunted Prickly Porky. ""So much the better. He always was a nuisance. Never did see such a fellow for making trouble for other people. No, Sir, I never did. The rest of us can have some peace now. Serves him right."" Prickly Porky went on chewing bark as if Chatterer's trouble was no concern of his.
"
437,452,12,4,"""Here's your trout, Mr. Otter,"" said he, as Little Joe put his head out of water to see who had frightened him so. ""Come and get it.""

But Little Joe wouldn't. The fact is, he was afraid to. He snarled at Buster Bear and called him a thief and everything bad he could think of. Buster didn't seem to mind. He chuckled as if he thought it all a great joke and repeated his invitation to Little Joe to come and get his fish. But Little Joe just turned his back and went off down the Laughing Brook in a great rage.

""It's too bad to waste such a fine fish,"" said Buster thoughtfully. ""I wonder what I'd better do with it."" And while he was wondering, he ate it all up. Then he started down the Laughing Brook to try to catch some for himself.
"
438,453,12,3,"""Chug-a-rum! He may be a bully, because great big people are very apt to be bullies, and though I haven't seen him, I guess Buster Bear is big enough from all I have heard, but I don't see how he is a thief,"" said Grandfather Frog.



""Didn't he catch my fish and eat them?"" snapped Little Joe. ""Doesn't that make him a thief?""



""They were no more your fish than mine,"" protested Billy Mink.



""Well, our fish, then! He stole our fish, if you like that any better. That makes him just as much a thief, doesn't it?"" growled Little Joe.



Grandfather Frog looked up at jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun and slowly winked one of his great, goggly eyes. ""There comes a foolish green fly,"" said he. ""Who does he belong to?""
"
439,454,12,3,"""If I wasn't afraid of being seen, I'd go up to the Old Pasture this very minute. Seems as if I could taste those berries."" He licked his lips hungrily as he spoke. Then his face brightened. ""I know what I'll do! I'll go up there at the very first peep of day to-morrow. I can eat all I want and get back to the Green Forest before there is any danger that Farmer Brown's boy or any one else I'm afraid of will see me. That's just what I'll do. My, I wish to-morrow morning would hurry up and come.""
"
440,455,4,5,"Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.

441,462,11,7,"She unfurled her long tentacle and the blue eye on its end blinked once. Gazing out into the wide purple sky, she wondered again if they were alone in the universe.

443,464,11,7,"The gleaming glass towers loomed up out of the restless waves all around. Bright lights danced across the water's surface, obscuring the murky past beneath. The sea level rose higher, and they built their towers higher in kind.
"
444,465,7,7,"The scarecrow’s chest seemed to writhe and ripple even though the day’s hot air was still. As Marla watched, the top button of its plaid shirt gave a violent twitch and a stream of dark greasy rats squealed out through the collar.

445,466,6,7,"Nebit followed quickly behind the black cat, remembering his grandfather’s words about their sacred powers. Soon the cat came to a stop, winding its whole body and tail around a tall thin staff leaning against a sycamore tree. The staff had the head of a strange animal. The pharaoh's staff!
"
446,469,7,7,"Pri shook out her beach towel, spraying a fine mist of sand back onto the ground. Then she folded the towel, tucked it back into her bag, and set off for the stairs back to civilization with the red setting sun glaring into her face. 

Her flip flops made a rhythmic <i>sik-thock-shhh</i> as she walked. This part of the beach was completely empty, now that she looked around– which was unusual since it was normally a favorite spot for canoodling couples. She brushed her hands together to rid them of sand. Some of it fell to her feet but the rest remained undisturbed. She stopped and wiped her hands more vigorously against her shorts. But looking down her hands were still covered in tiny beige granules. She picked at them but they wouldn’t budge. She noticed vaguely that her heart had begun galloping faster. She dug into one palm with her nail, determined now to pry the sand free from her skin– and it finally came loose. 

But as it fell something else happened too. A small sinkhole opened up where the grain of sand had just been. Now more sand was cascading through it, and more and more, widening the sinkhole until the center of her hand was nothing but a gaping emptiness with sand flowing through it like some insane hourglass. Then her fingers began to crumble and float away on the air. Pri tried to run, and even made it a few hopeful steps before she collapsed. 

Ten minutes later the sun was just a smoldering sliver on the horizon and the beach was empty once more. A pair of flip flops and an old beach bag sat on the sand in the growing darkness. The corner of a beach towel fluttered gently on the breeze.
"
447,472,7,7,"Calvin followed his classmates through the museum’s Bird Hall. Though the room was large and spacious, with high cathedral glass ceilings, Calvin felt claustrophobic. Birds of all shapes, sizes, colors, and species were suspended from ropes all around and above him. Most were frozen mid flight, their wings outstretched and still on the breezeless gallery air. Some were arranged in nesting positions, their glazed eyes staring but seeing nothing. 

He walked over to a black crowned crane whose feet were encased in shallow water that was really just plexiglass. He glanced at the information plaque then looked up into the bird’s wide pale eye. A chill ran down his spine. As he was turning to leave, a soft rustling made him look back. The crane’s head had tilted slightly and was now looking right at Calvin.

“Keep your little friends close,” it said, “next they’ll come for you.”

448,473,9,7,"""Dokkaebi” (doe-keh-bee) are a kind of goblin creature from Korean folklore. Dokkaebi appear in many forms, but are usually said to look impressive or scary– often arriving in a flash of large blue flames. These spirits are powerful and mischievous. They are as likely to play a trick on a passing human as they are to help them. Dokkaebi are formed when a spirit possesses an abandoned household item, or an object stained with human blood. They are known to sometimes carry magical items like an invisibility cloak or a club that can summon objects. 
	According to legends, dokkaebi are fantastic wrestlers, and are tough to defeat if they decide to challenge you. Some tales say their only weakness is their right side. Others say they only have one leg, and that can be their downfall. 
	But one story tells of an old man who tricked a dokkaebi into making him rich. He told the spirit that money was his greatest fear. The dokkaebi, seeking to frighten the man, threw bags and bags of money at him. Thinking he had won, the dokkaebi left, and the old man was richer than he ever could have dreamed!


"
449,474,9,7,"Baba Yaga is one of the most famous characters in Slavic and Russian folklore. She is usually portrayed as an ugly old woman– but sometimes she is three women all at once! Many legends tell of Baba Yaga appearing as three sisters, or three versions of herself. Sometimes this trio seeks to trick the hero of the story, but sometimes it only means to test or challenge them. 
	Baba Yaga is a mysterious and supernatural being. She is known to live in a hut deep in the dark woods. Unlike a normal cabin, Baba Yaga’s house is said to stand on gigantic chicken legs. But apart from her living space, Baba Yaga also likes to travel in style. Most accounts of Baba Yaga say she flies around in an oversized mortar and pestle. She sits in the mortar’s stone basin and wields the heavy pestle above her head like a club!

450,475,9,8,"The kumiho is a legendary nine-tailed fox. This creature appears in Korean folklore, but is derived from a similar figure in Chinese myth. The kumiho is a shapeshifter and can transform itself into a beautiful woman. It often uses this disguise to trick humans to steal their heart or liver. One aspect that separates the kumiho from its Chinese counterpart is a magic marble it is said to possess. This fox marble, or ""yeowoo guseul,” contains the great power and intelligence of the kumiho. It can also be used to steal human energy through a kiss. Some legends say that if a kumiho can resist eating human flesh for 1000 days it can become a true human itself. Alas, the fierce and vicious nature of the kumiho makes this a difficult ambition.
"
451,476,9,8,"The Huma bird is a mythological creature from Persian legends. According to ancient tales, the Huma flies through the sky for its entire life, without ever landing or touching the ground. Many depictions of the Huma show it with no legs at all. Some stories say the bird is invisible, possibly because it flies so incredibly high. Other stories say that only a rare few have seen the Huma, but that even a brief glimpse brings lifelong happiness. 
	The Huma contains both male and female natures within its body. It is considered to be a compassionate and extremely lucky creature. Part of this reputation comes from the myth that anyone touched on the head or shoulders by the shadow of a Huma bird shall become king. For this reason many kings wore feathers on their turbans that were said to be taken from the great Huma bird.

452,477,6,8,"Frederick tried to ignore the scratchy starch of his pressed collar against his neck and sit still. The golden lights in the grand theatre were fading out all around him. In a moment the enormous room was bathed in soft darkness. The murmuring crowd evaporated into absolute silence. He felt a shiver of unexpected anticipation run through his veins and then a moment of concentrated calm.
	Then the heavy velvet curtains parted. 
	The orchestra began to play, the music sweeping up and across the high, gilded ceiling. A single blue light fell upon the stage and at its center stood a girl in a delicate white tutu with her arms held gracefully above her head.

453,478,6,7,"Hilda churned the butter and she churned the butter and she churned the butter and she churned the butter some more. She thought that there really had to be more to life than this, but in all her 14 years she hadn’t seen it yet. 
	<i>Well</i>, she mused (as she continued churning the butter), <i>I milked the cows this morning to make this butter. What more exciting a variety of activities can I be hoping for?</i>
	Just then a stern, heavy woman with ruddy cheeks and a carved-in look of discontent stepped into the kitchen. She smoothed her apron against the front of her long dress over and over, something she always did when she was in a high temper (there was no smoother apron in all of the confederacy). 
	""Good afternoon, Aunt Gelda,” Hilda said looking up from her bucket. 
	""Where is your bonnet, girl? That head of yours is my shame but it ought to be yours!”
	""Apologies, Aunt Gelda, I took it off to wash my hair in the river and must have forgotten to put it back on again. It’s right here in my pocket though, I haven’t left it.”
	""What on this good earth were you doing washing your hair in the river for?” Aunt Gelda snapped, her mouth drawn into a hardened frown. ""I hardly know how it was that you became so foolish and unruly being born from two such reasonable and hard-working people as your parents.” She paused, staring as though expecting Hilda to have an answer for her. ""And get back to churning that butter already or I’ll be forced to throw you out for sheer unbelievable laziness.”
	And with that she stormed from the room. 


"
454,479,6,7,"The chugging of the train was like the ticking hands of a clock, marking the minutes of their passage through the countryside. Steam billowed by the window in long white streams. 
	Arabella checked once more to make sure her governess was asleep, then slipped out of her seat. She walked slowly towards the end of the train car, keeping her head bowed. 
	She knew it was horribly rude to stare, but even so, she couldn’t keep her eyes from darting in all directions. She had never been on a steam engine before, and for such a small space, there was an awful lot to see. 
	A man and a young boy in very fine suits and bowler hats sat together on her left. The boy was up on his knees with his beaming face pressed against the window. The man watched the boy with a concerned expression. He spun his golden wedding band round and round on his left ring finger. 
	Across the aisle and a few steps farther down sat an extravagant old woman with a birdcage placed on the seat to her right. She wore a beautiful scarlet brocade dress and a long, matching coat with inlaid brass buttons. Her hat’s brim was large enough to shade the face of the man sitting behind her. Sticking merrily out of its band was a single deep blue feather that exactly matched the occupant of her gilded cage. 
	Arabella moved on to the very back of the car and stopped. Nobody else seemed to have noticed, but the door to the next car had been left open.


"
455,480,6,8,"Richard made his steady way home from work up the sloping dirt road. Dark, two-storey wooden houses were stacked along either side, peering down at him. He carried his now empty metal lunchbox and watched his scuffed leather shoes eat up the distance to his door. 
	Behind his slumped shoulders five enormous black columns rose into 300 feet into the sky. Thick and endless clouds of grey smoke erupted from their tops and crept slowly over the city beyond. Richard had worked nearly every single day in that factory for the last 18 years. And though it had kept him housed and fed through the worst of the Depression times, most mornings he hoped to find that it had simply disappeared overnight. 

"
456,481,6,8,"Edgars and Morrow were already perched about 8 and 10 feet above me, respectively, and I was sitting 15 feet up myself. The mast was bending a bit under our weight and the wind was pummeling us in every direction. We weren’t far off the shore but if we didn’t pull the sail in quick, that gust was gonna dump the whole day’s worth of fish right back into the blasted sea. 
	I had the sail’s main line and was holding it taught as I could while the others scurried up the mast and tied the top. Down below on the deck I could see the tops of Weaver’s and Dunn’s capped heads running around trying to secure the cargo as best they could. 
	I didn’t realize it until I got into town later (with our fish thankfully doomed to land, mind), that the date was September 2nd, 1924. That little number on the calendar meant that I had been here in Egypt for exactly two years, and it still didn’t seem real. My life in the little town of Port Said was pleasant enough, but it still boggled my limited mind to try and figure how I wound up here– and whether any of us would ever have the chance to go back.


"
457,483,12,3,"""The Wolves are a free people,"" said Father Wolf. ""They take orders from the Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle-killer. The man's cub is ours—to kill if we choose.""

""Ye choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choosing? By the Bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dog's den for my fair dues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!""

The tiger's roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself clear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes, like two green moons in the darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan.
"
458,484,12,4,"""Oh, <i>you</i> are a man's cub,"" said the Black Panther, very tenderly; ""and even as I returned to my jungle, so you must go back to men at last,—to the men who are your brothers,—if you are not killed in the Council.""

 

""But why—but why should any wish to kill me?"" said Mowgli.

 

""Look at me,"" said Bagheera; and Mowgli looked at him steadily between the eyes. The big panther turned his head away in half a minute.

""<i>That</i> is why,"" he said, shifting his paw on the leaves. ""Not even I can look you between the eyes, and I was born among men, and I love you, Little Brother. The others they hate you because their eyes cannot meet yours. because you are wise. because you have pulled out thorns from their feet—because you are a man.""
"
459,485,10,4,"While I was young I lived upon my mother's milk, as I could not eat grass. In the daytime I ran by her side, and at night I lay down close by her. When it was hot we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees, and when it was cold we had a nice warm shed near the grove.

As soon as I was old enough to eat grass my mother used to go out to work in the daytime, and come back in the evening.

There were six young colts in the meadow besides me; they were older than I was; some were nearly as large as grown-up horses. I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop all together round and round the field as hard as we could go. Sometimes we had rather rough play, for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop.
"
460,486,12,5,"""Listen, man-cub,"" said the bear, and his voice rumbled like thunder on a hot night. ""I have taught you all the Law of the Jungle for all the Peoples of the Jungle—except the Monkey Folk who live in the trees. They have no Law. They are outcasts. They have no speech of their own, but use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen and peep and wait up above in the branches. Their way is not our way. They are without leaders. They have no remembrance. They boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter, and all is forgotten. We of the jungle have no dealings with them.”
"
461,487,10,5,"“Sawyer,” he cried in a stern voice, “is that pony made of flesh and blood?”

“Flesh and blood and temper,” he said; “he's too fond of his own will, and that won't suit me.” He spoke as if he was in a strong passion. He was a builder who had often been to the park on business.

“And do you think,” said master sternly, “that treatment like this will make him fond of your will?”

“He had no business to make that turn; his road was straight on!” said the man roughly.

“You have often driven that pony up to my place,” said master; “it only shows the creature's memory and intelligence; how did he know that you were not going there again? But that has little to do with it. I must say, Mr. Sawyer, that a more unmanly, brutal treatment of a little pony it was never my painful lot to witness, and by giving way to such passion you injure your own character as much, nay more, than you injure your horse; and remember, we shall all have to be judged according to our works, whether they be toward man or toward beast.”
"
462,488,10,3,"I was led to my new home, placed in a comfortable stable, fed, and left to myself. The next day, when the groom was cleaning my face, he said:

“That is just like the star that 'Black Beauty' had; he is much the same height, too. I wonder where he is now.”

A little further on he came to the place in my neck where I was bled and where a little knot was left in the skin. He almost started, and began to look me over carefully, talking to himself.

“White star in the forehead, one white foot on the off side, this little knot just in that place;” then looking at the middle of my back—“and, as I am alive, there is that little patch of white hair that John used to call 'Beauty's three-penny bit'. It must be 'Black Beauty'! Why, Beauty! Beauty! do you know me?—little Joe Green, that almost killed you?” And he began patting and patting me as if he was quite overjoyed.
"
463,489,10,6,"	""Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,"" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.
	""It's so dreadful to be poor!"" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.
	""I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all,"" added little Amy, with an injured sniff.
	""We've got father and mother and each other,"" said Beth contentedly, from her corner.
	The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly,—
	""We haven't got father, and shall not have him for a long time."" She didn't say ""perhaps never,"" but each silently added it, thinking of father far away, where the fighting was.
"
464,490,4,5,"She did not cry long, however, for she was as brave as could be expected of a princess of her age. After a good cry, she got up, and brushed the dust from her frock. Oh, what old dust it was! Then she wiped her eyes with her hands, for princesses don't always have their handkerchiefs in their pockets, any more than some other little girls I know of. Next, like a true princess, she resolved on going wisely to work to find her way back: she would walk through the passages, and look in every direction for the stair. This she did, but without success. She went over the same ground again an again without knowing it, for the passages and doors were all alike. At last, in a corner, through a half-open door, she did see a stair. But alas! it went the wrong way: instead of going down, it went up. Frightened as she was, however, she could not help wishing to see where yet further the stair could lead. It was very narrow, and so steep that she went on like a four-legged creature on her hands and feet.
"
465,491,13,6,"Many men had sought it; few had found it; and more than a few there were who had never returned from the quest. This lost mine was steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery. No one knew of the first man. The oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him. From the beginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying men had sworn to it, and to the mine the site of which it marked, clinching their testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the Northland.

But no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were dead; wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans, with Buck and half a dozen other dogs, faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. 
"
466,492,13,6,"""My lads,” said he, ""we've had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts. A turn ashore'll hurt nobody– the boats are still in the water; you can take the gigs, and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon. I'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown.”



I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling.
"
467,493,10,6,"	""Oh, what is it?"" exclaimed Jo trembling.
	""Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,"" replied Meg, with a tragic gesture.
Jo uttered a groan, and fell back in her chair; remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator. She turned scarlet, and was on the verge of crying, when she met Laurie's eyes, which <i>would</i> look merry in spite of his heroic efforts; the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. So did every one else, even ""Croaker,"" as the girls called the old lady; and the unfortunate dinner ended gayly, with bread and butter, olives and fun.
"
468,494,13,6,"Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller, and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that the weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the propeller was quiet, and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change was at hand. Francois leashed them and brought them on deck. At the first step upon the cold surface, Buck's feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More of this white stuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but more of it fell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone.
"
469,495,13,6,"Here were many men, and countless dogs, and Buck found them all at work. It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work. All day they swung up and down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling bells still went by. They hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up to the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa Clara Valley. Here and there Buck met Southland dogs, but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed. Every night, regularly, at nine, at twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie chant, in which it was Buck's delight to join.
"
470,496,10,5,"	""Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered the whole post-office, stuck outside,"" said Beth, laughing, as she went into the study, where Jo sat writing.
	""What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were the fashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, 'Why mind the fashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I said I would if I had one, and he has sent me this, to try me. I'll wear it, for fun, and show him I <i>don't</i> care for the fashion;"" and, hanging the antique broad-brim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.
"
471,497,13,6,"He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next to the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them. 
"
472,498,13,6,"Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship. One of the doctor's medical books lay open on the table, half of the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for pipelights. In the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber.

I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly, since the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober.
"
473,499,4,4,"“But how did you find your way to me?” persisted Curdie.

“I told you already,” answered Irene, “by keeping my finger upon my grandmother's thread, as I am doing now.”

“You don't mean you've got the thread there?”

“Of course I do. I have told you so ten times already. I have hardly—except when I was removing the stones—taken my finger off it. There!” she added, guiding Curdie's hand to the thread, “you feel it yourself—don't you?”

“I feel nothing at all,” replied Curdie. 

“Then what can be the matter with your finger? I feel it perfectly. To be sure it is very thin, and in the sunlight looks just like the thread of a spider, though there are many of them twisted together to make it—but for all that I can't think why you shouldn't feel it as well as I do.”

Curdie was too polite to say he did not believe there was any thread there at all. What he did say was:

“Well, I can make nothing of it.”

“I can, though, and you must be glad of that, for it will do for both of us.”
"
474,500,4,5,"If only he could get through in time to follow the goblins as they retreated! A few blows would doubtless be sufficient—just where his ear now lay; but if he attempted to strike there with his pickaxe, he would only hasten the departure of the family, put them on their guard, and perhaps lose their involuntary guidance. He therefore began to feel the wall with his hands, and soon found that some of the stones were loose enough to be drawn out with little noise.

Laying hold of a large one with both his hands, he drew it gently out, and let it down softly.

'What was that noise?' said the goblin father.

Curdie blew out his light, lest it should shine through.

'It must be that one miner that stayed behind the rest,' said the mother.

'No; he's been gone a good while. I haven't heard a blow for an hour. Besides, it wasn't like that.'

'Then I suppose it must have been a stone carried down the brook inside.'

'Perhaps. It will have more room by and by.'

Curdie kept quite still. After a little while, hearing nothing but the sounds of their preparations for departure, mingled with an occasional word of direction, and anxious to know whether the removal of the stone had made an opening into the goblins' house, he put in his hand to feel. It went in a good way, and then came in contact with something soft. He had but a moment to feel it over, it was so quickly withdrawn: it was one of the toeless goblin feet. The owner of it gave a cry of fright.

'What's the matter, Helfer?' asked his mother.

'A beast came out of the wall and licked my foot.'
"
475,501,10,4,"“It's a good growing day, isn't it?""

 

""It is, certain; too hot, almost. Why don't you put up your parasol?""

 

She extended her dress still farther over the article in question as she said, ""Oh dear no! I never put it up when the sun shines; pink fades awfully, you know, and I only carry it on cloudy Sundays; sometimes the sun comes out all of a sudden, and I have a dreadful time covering it up; it's the dearest thing in life to me, but it's an awful care.”
"
476,502,12,4,"""Stroll quietly down to Toad Hall?"" cried the Rat, greatly excited. ""What are you talking about? Do you mean to say you haven't <i>heard</i>?""

""Heard what?"" said Toad, turning rather pale. ""Go on, Ratty! Quick! Don't spare me! What haven't I heard?""

""Do you mean to tell me,"" shouted the Rat, thumping with his little fist upon the table, ""that you've heard nothing about the Stoats and Weasels?""

""What, the Wild Wooders?"" cried Toad, trembling in every limb. ""No, not a word! What have they been doing?""

""—And how they've been and taken Toad Hall?"" continued the Rat.

Toad leaned his elbows on the table, and his chin on his paws; and a large tear welled up in each of his eyes, overflowed and splashed on the table, plop! Plop!

""Go on, Ratty,"" he murmured presently; ""tell me all. The worst is over. I am an animal again. I can bear it.""

""When you—got—into that—that—trouble of yours,"" said the Rat, slowly and impressively; ""I mean, when you—disappeared from society for a time, over that misunderstanding about a—a machine, you know—""

Toad merely nodded.

""Well, it was a good deal talked about down here, naturally,"" continued the Rat, ""not only along the riverside, but even in the Wild Wood. Animals took sides, as always happens. The River-bankers stuck up for you, and said you had been infamously treated, and there was no justice to be had in the land nowadays. But the Wild Wood animals said hard things, and served you right, and it was time this sort of thing was stopped. And they got very cocky, and went about saying you were done for this time! You would never come back again, never, never!""
"
477,503,10,6,"“Well, good-by, Rebecca; good-day, Mirandy 'n' Jane. You've got a lively little girl there. I guess she'll be a first-rate company keeper.""

 

Miss Sawyer shuddered openly at the adjective ""lively"" as applied to a child; her belief being that though children might be seen, if absolutely necessary, they certainly should never be heard if she could help it. ""We're not much used to noise, Jane and me,"" she remarked acidly.
"
478,504,10,6,"“Joy and Duty"" had been the inspiring subject given to the older children for a speech to be written in five minutes.

 

Rebecca had wrestled, struggled, perspired in vain. When her turn came to read she was obliged to confess she had written nothing.

 

""You have at least two lines, Rebecca,"" insisted the teacher, ""for I see them on your slate.""

 

""I'd rather not read them, please; they are not good,"" pleaded Rebecca.

 

""Read what you have, good or bad, little or much; I am excusing nobody.""

 

Rebecca rose, overcome with secret laughter, dread, and mortification; then in a low voice she read the couplet:—

 

When Joy and Duty clash

Let Duty go to smash.

 

Dick Carter's head disappeared under the desk, while Living Perkins choked with laughter.
"
479,505,12,4,"As he gazed, something bright and small seemed to twinkle down in the heart of it, vanished, then twinkled once more like a tiny star. But it could hardly be a star in such an unlikely situation; and it was too glittering and small for a glow-worm. Then, as he looked, it winked at him, and so declared itself to be an eye; and a small face began gradually to grow up around it, like a frame around a picture.

A brown little face, with whiskers.

A grave round face, with the same twinkle in its eye that had first attracted his notice.

Small neat ears and thick silky hair.

It was the Water Rat!

Then the two animals stood and regarded each other cautiously.

""Hullo, Mole!"" said the Water Rat.

""Hullo, Rat!"" said the Mole.
"
480,506,12,6,"One morning the girl was very thoughtful, and answered at random, and did not seem to Toad to be paying proper attention to his witty sayings and sparkling comments.

""Toad,"" she said presently, ""just listen, please. I have an aunt who is a washerwoman.""

""There, there,"" said Toad, graciously and affably, ""never mind; think no more about it. <i>I</i> have several aunts who <i>ought</i> to be washerwomen.""

""Do be quiet a minute, Toad,"" said the girl. ""You talk too much, that's your chief fault, and I'm trying to think, and you hurt my head. As I said, I have an aunt who is a washerwoman; she does the washing for all the prisoners in this castle—we try to keep any paying business of that sort in the family, you understand. She takes out the washing on Monday morning, and brings it in on Friday evening. This is a Thursday. Now, this is what occurs to me: you're very rich—at least you're always telling me so—and she's very poor. A few pounds wouldn't make any difference to you, and it would mean a lot to her. Now, I think if she were properly approached—squared, I believe is the word you animals use—you could come to some arrangement by which she would let you have her dress and bonnet and so on, and you could escape from the castle as the official washerwoman. You're very alike in many respects—particularly about the figure.""

""We're <i>not</i>,"" said the Toad in a huff. ""I have a very elegant figure—for what I am.""

""So has my aunt,"" replied the girl, ""for what <i>she</i> is. But have it your own way. You horrid, proud, ungrateful animal, when I'm sorry for you, and trying to help you!""
"
481,507,5,5,"The queen was in the parlour, eating bread and honey. But at the second mouthful she burst out crying, and could not swallow it.

The king heard her sobbing. Glad of anybody, but especially of his queen, to quarrel with, he clashed his gold sovereigns into his money-box, clapped his crown on his head, and rushed into the parlour.

""What is all this about?"" exclaimed he. ""What are you crying for, queen?""

""I can't eat it,"" said the queen, looking ruefully at the honey-pot.

""No wonder!"" retorted the king. ""You've just eaten your breakfast—two turkey eggs, and three anchovies.""

""Oh, that's not it!"" sobbed her Majesty. ""It's my child, my child!""

""Well, what's the matter with your child? She's neither up the chimney nor down the draw-well. Just hear her laughing.""

Yet the king could not help a sigh, which he tried to turn into a cough, saying—

""It is a good thing to be light-hearted, I am sure, whether she be ours or not.""

""It is a bad thing to be light-headed,"" answered the queen, looking with prophetic soul far into the future.

""'Tis a good thing to be light-handed,"" said the king.

""'Tis a bad thing to be light-fingered,"" answered the queen.

""'Tis a good thing to be light-footed,"" said the king.

""'Tis a bad thing—"" began the queen; but the king interrupted her.

""In fact,"" said he, with the tone of one who concludes an argument in which he has had only imaginary opponents, and in which, therefore, he has come off triumphant—""in fact, it is a good thing altogether to be light-bodied.""

""But it is a bad thing altogether to be light-minded,"" retorted the queen, who was beginning to lose her temper.
"
482,508,5,4,"The poor princess nearly went out of the little mind she had. It was awful to her to see the lake, which she loved more than any living thing, lie dying before her eyes. It sank away, slowly vanishing. The tops of rocks that had never been seen till now, began to appear far down in the clear water. Before long they were dry in the sun. It was fearful to think of the mud that would soon lie there baking and festering, full of lovely creatures dying, and ugly creatures coming to life, like the unmaking of a world. And how hot the sun would be without any lake! She could not bear to swim in it anymore, and began to pine away. Her life seemed bound up with it; and ever as the lake sank, she pined. People said she would not live an hour after the lake was gone.

But she never cried.
"
483,509,5,4,"""What business had you to pull me down out of the water, and throw me to the bottom of the air? I never did you any harm.""

""Pardon me. I did not mean to hurt you.""

""I don't believe you have any brains; and that is a worse loss than your wretched gravity. I pity you.""

The prince now saw that he had come upon the bewitched princess, and had already offended her. But before he could think what to say next, she burst out angrily, giving a stamp with her foot that would have sent her aloft again but for the hold she had of his arm,—

""Put me up directly.""

""Put you up where, you beauty?"" asked the prince.

 He had fallen in love with her almost, already; for her anger made her more charming than any one else that had ever beheld her; and, as far as he could see, which certainly was not far, she had not a single fault about her, except, of course, that she had not any gravity. No prince, however, would judge of a princess by weight. The loveliness of her foot he would hardly estimate by the depth of the impression it could make in mud.

""Put you up where, you beauty?"" asked the prince.

""In the water, you fool!"" answered the princess.

""Come, then,"" said the prince.
"
484,510,10,4,"Heidi sat down quietly on her chair. Nobody said a word, and there was an uncomfortable silence. At last Miss Rottenmeier began with a severe and solemn voice: ""I shall speak with you later, Adelheid. How can you leave the house without a word? Your behavior was very remiss. The idea of walking about till so late!""

 

""Meow!"" was the reply.

 

""I didn't,"" Heidi began—""Meow!""

 

Sebastian nearly flung the dish on the table, and disappeared.

 

""This is enough,"" Miss Rottenmeier tried to say, but her voice was hoarse with fury. ""Get up and leave the room.""

Heidi got up. She began again. ""I made—"" ""Meow! meow! meow!—""

 

""Heidi,"" said Clara now, ""why do you always say 'meow' again, if you see that Miss Rottenmeier is angry?""

 

""I am not doing it, it's the kittens,"" she explained.

 

""What? Cats? Kittens?"" screamed the housekeeper. ""Sebastian, Tinette, take the horrible things away!"" With that she ran into the study, locking herself in, for she feared kittens beyond anything on earth. 
"
485,511,10,6,"Here lived Peter the goatherd, a boy eleven years old, who daily fetched the goats from the village and drove them up the mountain to the short and luscious grasses of the pastures. Peter raced down in the evening with the light-footed little goats. When he whistled sharply through his fingers, every owner would come and get his or her goat. These owners were mostly small boys and girls and, as the goats were friendly, they did not fear them. That was the only time Peter spent with other children, the rest of the day the animals were his sole companions. At home lived his mother and an old blind grandmother, but he only spent enough time in the hut to swallow his bread and milk for breakfast and the same for supper. After that he sought his bed to sleep. He always left early in the morning and at night he came home late, so that he could be with his friends as long as possible. His father had met with an accident some years ago; he also had been called Peter the goatherd. 
"
486,512,12,7,"“I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents. My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing. When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars. She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder. My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction. He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again. He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain. The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art.”

“Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,” said a Bengal Light; “I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.”
"
487,513,10,5,"Very soon after Heidi had gone up, before it was quite dark, the old man also sought his bed. He was always up in the morning with the sun, which rose early over the mountain-side in those summer days. It was a wild, stormy night; the hut was shaking in the gusts and all the boards were creaking. The wind howled through the chimney and the old fir-trees shook so strongly that many a dry branch came crashing down. In the middle of the night the grandfather got up, saying to himself: ""I am sure she is afraid."" Climbing up the ladder, he went up to Heidi's bed. The first moment everything lay in darkness, when all of a sudden the moon came out behind the clouds and sent his brilliant light across Heidi's bed. Her cheeks were burning red and she lay peacefully on her round and chubby arms. She must have had a happy dream, for she was smiling in her sleep. The grandfather stood and watched her till a cloud flew over the moon and left everything in total darkness. Then he went down to seek his bed again.
"
488,514,6,7,"Chef Barroux hunched over with his hands on the knees of his dirty white apron until his greasy nose was almost touching Leon’s. Out of the corner of his eye, Leon noticed all the other cooks and scullery maids scuttling from the kitchen in a cloud of whispers.

“Now you listen to me, <i>petit frère</i>,” Barroux said in his low growl, “you can mouth off to me all you want, <i>oui oui oui</i>, we will ‘andle it down ‘ere in ze servants quarters where I am king. But if you bring zat tongue up to Master <i>Owens</i>,” he pronounced the name as though uttering a swear, “you’re going to ‘ave bigger problems.”

Leon said nothing but stared hard into Barroux’s dark, tired eyes. Barroux held his gaze for a moment and then rose, turning away from the boy.

“Things are different since ze war. Ze English do not dance anymore.” 
"
489,515,13,7,"White Fang could scarcely realise that he was free. Many months had gone by since he passed into the possession of Beauty Smith, and in all that period he had never known a moment of freedom except at the times he had been loosed to fight with other dogs. Immediately after such fights he had always been imprisoned again.

He did not know what to make of it. Perhaps some new devilry of the gods was about to be perpetrated on him. He walked slowly and cautiously, prepared to be assailed at any moment. He did not know what to do, it was all so unprecedented. He took the precaution to sheer off from the two watching gods, and walked carefully to the corner of the cabin. Nothing happened. He was plainly perplexed, and he came back again, pausing a dozen feet away and regarding the two men intently.
"
490,516,12,7,"It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down and rest. However, he went on bravely, and at last he reached the market. After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.

“It has certainly been a hard day,” said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, “but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.”

Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.

“Upon my word,” said the Miller, “you are very lazy. Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish. You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend. But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means? Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain. Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.”
"
491,517,13,7,"Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.

But there <i>was</i> life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow. The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it. 
"
492,518,10,8,"	Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties, and, informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly, and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie, and was at her ease very soon; but Jo, who didn't care much for girls or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower-garden. Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life. She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the group near her dwindled away, till she was left alone. She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burnt breadth would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big red-headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the same refuge; for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face to face with the ""Laurence boy.""
"
493,519,13,7,"By this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had fallen away from the three people. Shorn of its glamour and romance, Arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and womanhood. Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and brother. To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do. Their irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it, doubled upon it, outdistanced it. The wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of speech and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. They had no inkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain; their muscles ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because of this they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their lips in the morning and last at night.
"
494,520,13,8,"And not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became alive again. The domesticated generations fell from him. In vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down. It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks. They came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been his always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and dust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him. And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and the cold, and dark.

Thus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the North.
"
495,521,10,7,"	If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she would have answered at once, ""My nose."" When she was a baby, Jo had accidentally dropped her into the coal-hod, and Amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big, nor red, like poor ""Petrea's""; it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself, and it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.
"
496,522,10,7,"""Mr. Morrison thinks the grammar will be returned, and lent me another,"" Huldah continued. ""He was rather snippy about my leaving a book in the hall. There was a perfectly elegant gentleman in the office, a stranger to me. I wish he was a new teacher, but there's no such luck. He was too young to be the father of any of the girls, and too old to be a brother, but he was handsome as a picture and had on an awful stylish suit of clothes. He looked at me about every minute I was in the room. It made me so embarrassed I couldn't hardly answer Mr. Morrison's questions straight.""
	""You'll have to wear a mask pretty soon, if you're going to have any comfort, Huldah,"" said Rebecca. ""Did he offer to lend you his class pin, or has it been so long since he graduated that he's left off wearing it? And tell us now whether the principal asked for a lock of your hair to put in his watch?""
	This was all said merrily and laughingly, but there were times when Huldah could scarcely make up her mind whether Rebecca was trying to be witty, or whether she was jealous; but she generally decided it was merely the latter feeling, rather natural in a girl who had little attention.
"
497,523,10,7,"""If they sell two hundred more cakes this month and next, they can have the lamp by Christmas,"" Rebecca answered, ""and they can get a shade by summer time; but I'm afraid I can't help very much after today, because my aunt Miranda may not like to have me.""

""I see. Well, that's all right. I'll take three hundred cakes, and that will give them shade and all.""

Rebecca had been seated on a stool very near to the edge of the porch, and at this remark she made a sudden movement, tipped over, and disappeared into a clump of lilac bushes. It was a very short distance, fortunately, and the amused capitalist picked her up, set her on her feet, and brushed her off.

""You should never seem surprised when you have taken a large order,"" said he; ""you ought to have replied 'Can't you make it three hundred and fifty?' instead of capsizing in that unbusinesslike way.""
"
498,524,4,7,"For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face and large eyes like a frog.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, ""For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet."" The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, ""From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet."" Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together.
"
499,525,12,7,"So at last they were in the secret passage, and the cutting-out expedition had really begun!

It was cold, and dark, and damp, and low, and narrow, and poor Toad began to shiver, partly from dread of what might be before him, partly because he was wet through. The lantern was far ahead, and he could not help lagging behind a little in the darkness. Then he heard the Rat call out warningly, ""<i>Come</i> on, Toad!"" and a terror seized him of being left behind, alone in the darkness, and he ""came on"" with such a rush that he upset the Rat into the Mole, and the Mole into the Badger, and for a moment all was confusion. 
"
500,526,13,8,"He had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my ""weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg” and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and repeat his orders to look out for ""the seafaring man with one leg.”

How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the middle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.
"
501,527,13,8,"And he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly recognized—none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the three red crosses, that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captain's chest. Why the doctor had given it to him was more than I could fancy.

But if it were inexplicable to me, the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers. They leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse. It went from hand to hand, one tearing it from another; and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied their examination, you would have thought, not only they were fingering the very gold, but were at sea with it, besides, in safety.
"
502,528,12,7,"Then Toad fell on his knees among the coals, and, raising his clasped paws in supplication, cried, ""Save me, only save me, dear kind Mr. Engine-driver, and I will confess everything! I am not the simple washerwoman I seem to be! I have no children waiting for me, innocent or otherwise! I am a toad—the well-known and popular Mr. Toad, a landed proprietor; I have just escaped, by my great daring and cleverness, from a loathsome dungeon into which my enemies had flung me; and if those fellows on that engine recapture me, it will be chains and bread-and-water and straw and misery once more for poor, unhappy, innocent Toad!""

The engine-driver looked down upon him very sternly, and said, ""Now tell the truth; what were you put in prison for?""

""It was nothing very much,"" said poor Toad, colouring deeply. ""I only borrowed a motor-car while the owners were at lunch.""
"
503,529,13,7,"""My friends,"" I answered, making a sign for them to enter, ""you are not in Canada, but on board the Nautilus, fifty yards below the level of the sea.""

""But, M. Aronnax,"" said Ned Land, ""can you tell me how many men there are on board? Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred?""

""I cannot answer you, Mr. Land; it is better to abandon for a time all idea of seizing the Nautilus or escaping from it. This ship is a masterpiece of modern industry, and I should be sorry not to have seen it. Many people would accept the situation forced upon us, if only to move amongst such wonders. So be quiet and let us try and see what passes around us.""

""See!"" exclaimed the harpooner, ""but we can see nothing in this iron prison! We are walking—we are sailing—blindly.""

Ned Land had scarcely pronounced these words when all was suddenly darkness. The luminous ceiling was gone, and so rapidly that my eyes received a painful impression.

We remained mute, not stirring, and not knowing what surprise awaited us, whether agreeable or disagreeable. A sliding noise was heard: one would have said that panels were working at the sides of the Nautilus.

""It is the end of the end!"" said Ned Land.

Suddenly light broke at each side of the saloon, through two oblong openings. The liquid mass appeared vividly lit up by the electric gleam. Two crystal plates separated us from the sea. At first I trembled at the thought that this frail partition might break, but strong bands of copper bound them, giving an almost infinite power of resistance.

The sea was distinctly visible for a mile all round the Nautilus. What a spectacle! What pen can describe it? Who could paint the effects of the light through those transparent sheets of water, and the softness of the successive gradations from the lower to the superior strata of the ocean?
"
504,530,4,7,"""Get to your places!"" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.

Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time, the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting, ""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her head!"" about once in a minute.

""They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here,"" thought Alice; ""the great wonder is that there's anyone left alive!""
"
505,531,13,7,"""You are joking.""

""A true Englishman doesn't joke when he is talking about so serious a thing as a wager,"" replied Phileas Fogg, solemnly. ""I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours, or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes. Do you accept?""

""We accept,"" replied Messrs. Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, Flanagan, and Ralph, after consulting each other.

""Good,"" said Mr. Fogg. ""The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine. I will take it.""

""This very evening?"" asked Stuart.

""This very evening,"" returned Phileas Fogg. He took out and consulted a pocket almanac, and added, ""As today is Wednesday, the 2nd of October, I shall be due in London in this very room of the Reform Club, on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine p.m.; or else the twenty thousand pounds, now deposited in my name at Baring's, will belong to you, in fact and in right, gentlemen. Here is a cheque for the amount.""

A memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties, during which Phileas Fogg preserved a stoical composure. 
"
506,532,11,7,"""My friend,"" said Barbicane, ""if the moon is inhabited its inhabitants appeared some thousands of years before those of the earth, for it cannot be doubted that the moon is older than the earth. If, therefore, the Selenites have existed for thousands of centuries—if their brains are organised like that of human beings—they have invented all that we have invented, already, and even what we shall only invent in the lapse of centuries. They will have nothing to learn from us, and we shall have everything to learn from them.""

""What!"" answered Michel, ""do you think they have had artists like

Phidias, Michael Angelo, or Raphael?""

""Yes.""

""Poets like Homer, Virgil, Milton, Lamartine, and Hugo?""

""I am sure of it.""

""Philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant?""

""I have no doubt of it.""

""<i>Savants</i> like Archimedes, Euclid, Pascal, and Newton?""

""I could swear it.""

""Clowns like Arnal, and photographers like—Nadar?""

""I am certain of it.""

""Then, friend Barbicane, if these Selenites are as learned as we, and even more so, why have they not hurled a lunar projectile as far as the terrestrial regions?""

""Who says they have not done it?"" answered Barbicane seriously.
"
507,533,13,7,"This useless search could not last much longer. The Abraham Lincoln had nothing to reproach herself with, she had done her best to succeed. Never had an American ship's crew shown more zeal or patience; its failure could not be placed to their charge—there remained nothing but to return.

This was represented to the commander. The sailors could not hide their discontent, and the service suffered. I will not say there was a mutiny on board, but after a reasonable period of obstinacy, Captain Farragut (as Columbus did) asked for three days' patience. If in three days the monster did not appear, the man at the helm should give three turns of the wheel, and the Abraham Lincoln would make for the European seas.
"
508,534,13,7,"""Were you thrown into the sea by the shock to the frigate?""

""Yes, Professor; but more fortunate than you, I was able to find a footing almost directly upon a floating island.""

""An island?""

""Or, more correctly speaking, on our gigantic narwhal.""

""Explain yourself, Ned!""

""Only I soon found out why my harpoon had not entered its skin and was blunted.""

""Why, Ned, why?""

""Because, Professor, that beast is made of sheet iron.""

The Canadian's last words produced a sudden revolution in my brain. I wriggled myself quickly to the top of the being, or object, half out of the water, which served us for a refuge. I kicked it. It was evidently a hard, impenetrable body, and not the soft substance that forms the bodies of the great marine mammalia. But this hard body might be a bony covering, like that of the antediluvian animals; and I should be free to class this monster among amphibious reptiles, such as tortoises or alligators.

Well, no! the blackish back that supported me was smooth, polished, without scales. The blow produced a metallic sound; and, incredible though it may be, it seemed, I might say, as if it was made of riveted plates.

There was no doubt about it! This monster, this natural phenomenon that had puzzled the learned world, and overthrown and misled the imagination of seamen of both hemispheres, it must be owned was a still more astonishing phenomenon, in as much as it was a simply human construction.
"
509,535,4,7,"In the stillness and the darkness, realization soon began to supplement knowledge. The mere knowledge of a fact is pale; but when you come to <i>realize</i> your fact, it takes on color. It is all the difference between hearing of a man being stabbed to the heart, and seeing it done. In the stillness and the darkness, the knowledge that I was in deadly danger took to itself deeper and deeper meaning all the time; a something which was realization crept inch by inch through my veins and turned me cold.
"
510,536,13,8,"At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several miles; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods. They had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters, and the journey seemed on the point of being successfully accomplished, when the elephant, becoming restless, suddenly stopped.

It was then four o'clock.

""What's the matter?"" asked Sir Francis, putting out his head.

""I don't know, officer,"" replied the Parsee, listening attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick branches.

The murmur soon became more distinct; it now seemed like a distant concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments. Passepartout was all eyes and ears. Mr. Fogg patiently waited without a word. The Parsee jumped to the ground, fastened the elephant to a tree, and plunged into the thicket. He soon returned, saying:

""A procession of Brahmins is coming this way. We must prevent their seeing us, if possible.""

The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket, at the same time asking the travellers not to stir. He held himself ready to bestride the animal at a moment's notice, should flight become necessary; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage, in which they were wholly concealed.

The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer, and now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals. The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees, a hundred paces away; and the strange figures who performed the religious ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches. First came the priests, with mitres on their heads, and clothed in long lace robes. 
"
511,537,13,8,"This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons, and at that season of the year. The Chinese seas are usually boisterous, subject to terrible gales of wind, and especially during the equinoxes; and it was now early November.

It would clearly have been to the master's advantage to carry his passengers to Yokohama, since he was paid a certain sum per day; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage, and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach Shanghai. But John Bunsby believed in the Tankadere, which rode on the waves like a seagull; and perhaps he was not wrong.
"
512,538,11,8,"Nothing then. The obscurity was profound in the space capsule. Its cylindro-conical sides had resisted perfectly. There was not a break, a crack, or a dint in them. The admirable projectile was not hurt by the intense deflagration of the powders, instead of being liquefied, as it was feared, into a shower of aluminium.

In the interior there was very little disorder on the whole. A few objects had been violently hurled up to the roof, but the most important did not seem to have suffered from the shock. Their fastenings were intact.

On the movable disc, crushed down to the bottom by the smashing of the partitions and the escape of the water, three bodies lay motionless. Did Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan still breathe? Was the projectile nothing but a metal coffin carrying three corpses into space?
"
513,539,11,7,"""Ye gods!"" cried Michel Ardan; ""there will be a collision on the line!""

The three travellers instinctively drew back. Their terror was extreme, but it did not last long, hardly a few seconds. The asteroid passed at a distance of a few hundred yards from the projectile and disappeared, not so much on account of the rapidity of its course, but because its side opposite to the moon was suddenly confounded with the absolute darkness of space.

""A good journey to you!"" cried Michel Ardan, uttering a sigh of satisfaction. ""Is not infinitude large enough to allow a poor little space capsule to go about without fear? What was that pretentious globe which nearly knocked against us?""

""I know!"" answered Barbicane.

""Of course! you know everything.""

""It is a simple asteroid,"" said Barbicane; ""but so large that the attraction of the earth has kept it in the state of a satellite.""
"
514,540,4,7,"The boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to go to sleep. The old man began his tale; and presently the lad was asleep in reality; so also were the dogs, and the court, the lackeys, and the files of men-at-arms. The droning voice droned on; a soft snoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subdued accompaniment of wind instruments. Some heads were bowed upon folded arms, some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious music; the flies buzzed and bit, unmolested, the rats swarmed softly out from a hundred holes, and pattered about, and made themselves at home everywhere; and one of them sat up like a squirrel on the king’s head and held a bit of cheese in its hands and nibbled it, and dribbled the crumbs in the king’s face with naive and impudent irreverence. It was a tranquil scene, and restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit.
"
515,541,4,8,"	I let them give me a flint and steel; and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed Sandy and me on our horse, I lit my pipe. When the first blast of smoke shot out through the bars of my helmet, all those people broke for the woods, and Sandy went over backwards and struck the ground with a dull thud. They thought I was one of those fire-belching dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other professional liars. I had infinite trouble to persuade those people to venture back within explaining distance. Then I told them that this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none but my enemies. And I promised, with my hand on my heart, that if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass before me they should see that only those who remained behind would be struck dead. The procession moved with a good deal of promptness. There were no casualties to report, for nobody had curiosity enough to remain behind to see what would happen.
"
516,542,11,8,"	""Of course,” said I. ""But these foul creatures of yours—”
	""All in good time,” said he, waving his hand at me; ""I am only beginning. Those are trivial cases of alteration. Surgery can do better things than that. There is building up as well as breaking down and changing. You have heard, perhaps, of a common surgical operation resorted to in cases where the nose has been destroyed: a flap of skin is cut from the forehead, turned down on the nose, and heals in the new position. This is a kind of grafting in a new position of part of an animal upon itself. Grafting of freshly obtained material from another animal is also possible,—the case of teeth, for example. The grafting of skin and bone is done to facilitate healing: the surgeon places in the middle of the wound pieces of skin snipped from another animal, or fragments of bone from a victim freshly killed. Hunter's cock-spur—possibly you have heard of that—flourished on the bull's neck; and the rhinoceros rats of the Algerian zouaves are also to be thought of,—monsters manufactured by transferring a slip from the tail of an ordinary rat to its snout, and allowing it to heal in that position.”
	""Monsters manufactured!” said I. ""Then you mean to tell me—”
	""Yes. These creatures you have seen are animals carven and wrought into new shapes. To that, to the study of the plasticity of living forms, my life has been devoted. I have studied for years, gaining in knowledge as I go. I see you look horrified, and yet I am telling you nothing new. It all lay in the surface of practical anatomy years ago, but no one had the temerity to touch it. It is not simply the outward form of an animal which I can change. The physiology, the chemical rhythm of the creature, may also be made to undergo an enduring modification.”


"
517,543,7,8,"When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door—which they call by a name meaning ""word-bearer”—came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them up. I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were ""Ordog”—Satan, ""pokol”—hell, ""stregoica”—witch, ""vrolok” and ""vlkoslak”—both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Serbian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire. (<i>Note:</i> I must ask the Count about these superstitions).
"
518,544,11,8,"	We drifted famishing, and, after our water had come to an end, tormented by an intolerable thirst, for eight days altogether. After the second day the sea subsided slowly to a glassy calm. It is quite impossible for the ordinary reader to imagine those eight days. He has not, luckily for himself, anything in his memory to imagine with. After the first day we said little to one another, and lay in our places in the boat and stared at the horizon, or watched, with eyes that grew larger and more haggard every day, the misery and weakness gaining upon our companions. The sun became pitiless. The water ended on the fourth day, and we were already thinking strange things and saying them with our eyes; but it was, I think, the sixth before Helmar gave voice to the thing we had all been thinking. I remember our voices were dry and thin, so that we bent towards one another and spared our words. I stood out against it with all my might, was rather for scuttling the boat and perishing together among the sharks that followed us; but when Helmar said that if his proposal was accepted we should have drink, the sailor came round to him.
"
519,545,11,8,"	I was convinced now, absolutely assured, that Moreau had been vivisecting a human being. All the time since I had heard his name, I had been trying to link in my mind in some way the grotesque animalism of the islanders with his abominations; and now I thought I saw it all. The memory of his work on the transfusion of blood recurred to me. These creatures I had seen were the victims of some hideous experiment. These sickening scoundrels had merely intended to keep me back, to fool me with their display of confidence, and presently to fall upon me with a fate more horrible than death,—with torture; and after torture the most hideous degradation it is possible to conceive.
"
520,546,7,8,"Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was, whether man or beast, I could not tell.
"
521,547,7,8,"Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed.
"
522,548,13,7,"""When did the Kukuana people come into this country?""

""My lord, the race came down here like the breath of a storm ten thousand thousand moons ago, from the great lands which lie there beyond,"" and he pointed to the north. ""They could travel no further because of the high mountains which ring in the land, so say the old voices of our fathers that have descended to us the children, and so says Gagool, the wise woman, the smeller out of witches,"" and again he pointed to the snow-clad peaks. ""The country, too, was good, so they settled here and grew strong and powerful, and now our numbers are like the sea sand, and when Twala the king calls up his regiments their plumes cover the plain so far as the eye of man can reach.""
"
523,549,13,8,"On she led us, straight to the top of the vast and silent cave, where we found another doorway, not arched as the first was, but square at the top, something like the doorways of Egyptian temples.

""Are ye prepared to enter the Place of Death, white men?"" asked Gagool, evidently with a view to making us feel uncomfortable.

""Lead on, Macduff,"" said Good solemnly, trying to look as though he was not at all alarmed, as indeed we all did except Foulata, who caught Good by the arm for protection.

""This is getting rather ghastly,"" said Sir Henry, peeping into the dark passageway. ""Come on, Quatermain—<i>seniores priores</i>. We mustn't keep the old lady waiting!"" and he politely made way for me to lead the van, for which inwardly I did not bless him.

<i>Tap, tap,</i> went old Gagool's stick down the passage, as she trotted along, chuckling hideously.
"
524,550,13,8,"""‘Good-bye, senor,' he said; 'if ever we meet again I shall be the richest man in the world, and I will remember you.' I laughed a little—I was too weak to laugh much—and watched him strike out for the great desert to the west, wondering if he was mad, or what he thought he was going to find there.

""A week passed, and I got the better of my fever. One evening I was sitting on the ground in front of the little tent I had with me, chewing the last leg of a miserable fowl I had bought from a native for a bit of cloth worth twenty fowls, and staring at the hot red sun sinking down over the desert, when suddenly I saw a figure, apparently that of a European, for it wore a coat, on the slope of the rising ground opposite to me, about three hundred yards away. The figure crept along on its hands and knees, then it got up and staggered forward a few yards on its legs, only to fall and crawl again. Seeing that it must be somebody in distress, I sent one of my hunters to help him, and presently he arrived, and who do you suppose it turned out to be?""

""José Silvestre, of course,"" said Captain Good.

""Yes, José Silvestre, or rather his skeleton and a little skin. His face was a bright yellow with bilious fever, and his large dark eyes stood nearly out of his head, for all the flesh had gone. There was nothing but yellow parchment-like skin, white hair, and the gaunt bones sticking up beneath.”
"
525,551,7,7,"The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. 
"
526,552,11,8,"I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown <i>him</i> far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested.
"
527,553,11,7,"“In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale, chinless faces and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!—as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had almost burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match … and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks, and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.

“That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.”
"
528,554,10,8,"Neil gazed idly at the rippling shadow shapes his fingers made on the wall beside his bed. As he did, he was only vaguely aware of how determinedly his brain would focus on anything other than getting up and going to his first day of high school.
"
529,555,11,8,"	""I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round. The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight.
	""The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now.
	""Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine.”


"
530,556,8,8,"	With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to Lestrade’s note-book, in which the prisoner’s words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.
	""It don’t much matter to you why I hated these men,” he said; ""it’s enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings—a father and a daughter—and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You’d have done the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.”


"
531,557,8,7,"""For example, observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram.""

""Right!"" said I. ""Right on both points! But I confess that I don't see how you arrived at it. It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have mentioned it to no one.""

""It is simplicity itself,"" he remarked, chuckling at my surprise,—""so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep. Just opposite the Seymour Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in the neighborhood. So much is observation. The rest is deduction.""

""How, then, did you deduce the telegram?""

""Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat opposite to you all morning. I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards. What could you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire? Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.""
"
532,558,8,8,"	It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed. Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards. He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side. 
"
533,559,8,7,"“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”

His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.

“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm.

“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.”

“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a laugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police News of the Past.’”

“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. “I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for I dabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.
"
534,560,8,8,"	""You amaze me, Holmes,” said I. ""Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.”
	""There’s no room for a mistake,” he answered. ""The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse’s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning—I have Gregson’s word for that—it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.”


"
535,561,8,7,"“‘You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter. My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure, and that I have clung to Morstan's share as well as to my own. I wish you, therefore, to make restitution. Put your ears down to my mouth. The treasure is hidden in—' At this instant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I can never forget, 'Keep him out! For Christ's sake keep him out!' We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed. A face was looking in at us out of the darkness. We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass. It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence. My brother and I rushed towards the window, but the man was gone. When we returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat.

""We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder, save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face. We soon, however, had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us. The window of my father's room was found open in the morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words 'The sign of the four' scrawled across it. What the phrase meant, or who our secret visitor may have been, we never knew. As far as we can judge, none of my father's property had been actually stolen, though everything had been turned out. My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it is still a complete mystery to us.""


"
536,562,11,8,"“In this laboratory we have certain strict rules, Ms. Lieux,” Olgov continued, “without them our palace of science would dissolve into a chaotic pit. The first rule, and one I hope you are never misfortunate enough as to forget, is: never, under any circumstances, should you enter Lab 6.”

 
"
537,563,10,7,"Much to our disappointment it was dark when we reached Carlisle—too dark to see anything very distinctly, as we drove up the lane of the old King homestead on the hill. Behind us a young moon was hanging over southwestern meadows of spring-time peace, but all about us were the soft, moist shadows of a May night. We peered eagerly through the gloom.

“There’s the big willow, Bev,” whispered Felix excitedly, as we turned in at the gate.

There it was, in truth—the tree Grandfather King had planted when he returned one evening from ploughing in the brook field and stuck the willow switch he had used all day in the soft soil by the gate.

It had taken root and grown; our father and our uncles and aunts had played in its shadow; and now it was a massive thing, with a huge girth of trunk and great spreading boughs, each of them as large as a tree in itself.
"
538,564,10,8,"But one evening the news came. Anne was sitting at her open window, for the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the world, as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with flower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the stir of poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying down through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a fluttering newspaper in her hand.

Anne sprang to her feet, knowing at once what that paper contained. The pass list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt her. 
"
539,565,10,8,"She flung herself into her studies heart and soul, determined not to be outdone in any class by Gilbert Blythe. The rivalry between them was soon apparent; it was entirely good natured on Gilbert’s side; but it is much to be feared that the same thing cannot be said of Anne, who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for holding grudges. She was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves. She would not stoop to admit that she meant to rival Gilbert in schoolwork, because that would have been to acknowledge his existence which Anne persistently ignored; but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated between them. Now Gilbert was head of the spelling class; now Anne, with a toss of her long red braids, spelled him down. One morning Gilbert had all his sums done correctly and had his name written on the blackboard on the roll of honor; the next morning Anne, having wrestled wildly with decimals the entire evening before, would be first. One awful day they were ties and their names were written up together. It was almost as bad as a take-notice and Anne’s mortification was as evident as Gilbert’s satisfaction. When the written examinations at the end of each month were held the suspense was terrible. The first month Gilbert came out three marks ahead. The second Anne beat him by five. But her triumph was marred by the fact that Gilbert congratulated her heartily before the whole school. It would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had felt the sting of his defeat.
"
540,566,10,8,"“It’s utterly out of the question,” said Aunt Janet seriously. When Aunt Janet said seriously that anything was out of the question it meant that she was thinking about it, and would probably end up by doing it. If a thing really was out of the question she merely laughed and refused to discuss it at all.
"
541,567,10,8,"If Anne had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she had ascended Diana would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and there. Fortunately she fell on the other side, where the roof extended down over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was a much less serious thing. Nevertheless, when Diana and the other girls had rushed frantically around the house– except Ruby Gillis, who remained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics– they found Anne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the Virginia creeper.

 

“Anne, are you killed?” shrieked Diana, throwing herself on her knees beside her friend. “Oh, Anne, dear Anne, speak just one word to me and tell me if you’re killed.”

 

To the immense relief of all the girls, and especially of Josie Pye, who, in spite of lack of imagination, had been seized with horrible visions of a future branded as the girl who was the cause of Anne Shirley’s early and tragic death, Anne sat dizzily up and answered uncertainly:

 

“No, Diana, I am not killed, but I think I am rendered unconscious.”
"
542,568,10,7,"Peg Bowen’s house was nearly a mile away, even by the short cut past the swamp and up the wooded hill. We went down through the brook field and over the little plank bridge in the hollow, half lost in its surrounding sea of farewell summers. When we reached the green gloom of the woods beyond we began to feel frightened, but nobody would admit it. We walked very closely together, and we did not talk. When you are near the retreat of witches and folk of that ilk the less you say the better, for their feelings are so notoriously touchy. Of course, Peg wasn’t a witch, but it was best to be on the safe side.
"
543,569,10,8,"An expression flashed into her eyes that a practiced character reader might have connected vaguely with the set look she had worn in the barber's chair—somehow a development of it. It was quite a new look for Bernice—and it carried consequences.

She went stealthily to the bureau, picked up an article that lay there, and turning out all the lights stood quietly until her eyes became accustomed to the darkness. Softly she pushed open the door to Marjorie's room. She heard the quiet, even breathing of an untroubled conscience asleep.

She was by the bedside now, very deliberate and calm. She acted swiftly. Bending over she found one of the braids of Marjorie's hair, followed it up with her hand to the point nearest the head, and then holding it a little slack so that the sleeper would feel no pull, she reached down with the shears and severed it.
"
544,570,10,8,"It was finished at last, even to the pedestal, and Aldred stepped back and looked at it with mixed feelings. She had done her very best; she dared not add another impress, from fear of spoiling it, yet she knew how far it fell short of her ideal.

""I wonder if Phidias used to be contented with what he'd done?"" she thought. ""I suppose he was the greatest sculptor that ever lived. I remember reading that Millais once went to an exhibition of his own pictures, and came away very dejected. Shall I ask them all to come and see it now? I want so much to show it, but somehow I hardly dare. I almost think I'll leave it for somebody to find out, and just go back to the rink and say nothing.""

She had not counted, however, on Mabel, who, missing her friend for an unusual length of time, took off her skates and went to hunt for her, tracking her in the end by her footsteps in the snow. Mabel's amazement when she reached the lawn was only equalled by her admiration. She rushed off instantly to fetch all the girls to look, even venturing to knock at the study door and report her news at head-quarters.

Aldred's snow statue made quite a sensation at the Grange. Miss Drummond thought so highly of it that she had it photographed, and invited many of her friends from Chetbourne to come and see it. It was such a daring and original project for a girl of only fifteen to have carried out entirely alone that she felt it reflected credit on the school to possess so clever a pupil. Aldred was praised to her heart's content, and received so much attention from teachers and visitors that she could certainly consider herself, for the time being, the most important person at Birkwood. She was petted by the prefects, invited to skate by members of the Sixth Form who had ignored her existence before, and asked so often for her autograph that she grew almost tired of signing her name.
"
545,571,10,8,"Marusha watched as the three dots rippled tantalizingly across her phone screen. She was half ecstatic that they were there at all, and half desperate for them to disappear. Each dot felt like it could be the period marking the end of all her dreams for junior year.
"
546,572,10,8,"Emile capped his pen and stepped back from the metal door, surveying his tag amongst all the others that covered the alley wall. To the unobservant eye, it might have fit right in– but to him the lines still looked woefully hesitant; the style, sloppy.
"
547,573,10,8,"""Go to bed, you silly child,"" laughed Mrs. Harvey. ""I wouldn't have told you that if I'd thought you were going to remember it. And I think most of your ideas are perfectly idiotic,"" she finished sleepily.

There was another silence, while Marjorie considered whether or not convincing her mother was worth the trouble. People over forty can seldom be permanently convinced of anything. At eighteen our convictions are hills from which we look; at forty-five they are caves in which we hide.
"
548,574,10,7,"Bernice stood on the curb and looked at the sign, Sevier Barber-Shop. It was a guillotine indeed, and the hangman was the first barber, who, attired in a white coat and smoking a cigarette, leaned nonchalantly against the first chair. He must have heard of her; he must have been waiting all week, smoking eternal cigarettes beside that portentous, too-often-mentioned first chair. Would they blind-fold her? No, but they would tie a white cloth round her neck lest any of her blood—nonsense—hair—should get on her clothes.
"
549,575,10,7,"Aldred replied as briefly as possible to these various interrogations, but Ursula seemed quite satisfied with ""Yes"" and ""No"" for an answer, and rattled on: ""I'm rather sorry for you, being put in No. 2 dormitory, because you'll be with Fifth Form girls, and you can't expect them to be particularly chummy with you. If there had only been room, now, in No. 5! But we're full up, all six beds; there isn't even a corner for a shakedown. We have such jokes in the mornings, when we're getting up! It's a pity you'll be out of it. I'd like you to see Dora Maxwell acting a peacock; you'd simply scream! Of course, we daren't make too much noise, or we should have a monitress pouncing down upon us; but it's ever such fun, all the same. They're a very prim set in No. 2. They never lost a single order mark last term! Well, if you can't be in our dormitory you'll be with us in class, at any rate, and it isn't dull there by any means, I can tell you.""

""How many girls are there in the Fourth Form?"" asked Aldred.

""There were seven before, but you'll make eight. Why, most of them are in the room now, or on the lawn just outside, so I can point them out to you. That's Phœbe Stanhope standing by the fireplace,—the one with the long light pigtail and the blue blouse; she's talking to Lorna Hallam, and Agnes Maxwell is showing her camera to them both. Now, if you'll look through the window you'll see two girls walking arm in arm round the sundial; the fair one is Dora Maxwell, and the dark one is Myfanwy James. Dora is tremendously jolly; she and Myfanwy think of the most outlandish things to do. Why, one night they went to bed right underneath their bottom sheets, and put their pillows over their faces, and when Freda Martin (that's our prefect) came to turn out the lights she thought they weren't there at all, and was just going to make a tremendous fuss, when Myfanwy couldn't stand it any longer, and exploded! We six are in the same dormitory, and we're the greatest chums. We call ourselves 'The Clan', and each is pledged to back the others up through thick and thin, whatever happens.""
"
550,576,4,7,"“I wish we had a few Manticoras here now. But the last died hundreds of years ago—worse luck!""

Then the King ran and opened the book at the page that had ""cora"" on it, and there was the picture—Manticora, all yellow, with a lion's body and a man's face, just as the Chancellor had said. And under the picture was written, ""Manticora.""

In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book, rubbing its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously. It seemed very stupid, and when Lionel gave it a push and said, ""Go along and fight the Dragon, do,"" it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and hid behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were asleep it went around and ate all the pussy-cats in the town. And then it mewed more than ever. And on the Saturday morning, when people were a little timid about going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for calling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the milk that was left in the cans at the doors for people's teas, and it ate the cans as well.
"
551,577,4,7,"And, sure enough, it <i>was</i> a dragon—a great, shining, winged, scaly, clawy, big-mouthed dragon—made of pure ice. It must have gone to sleep curled around the hole where the warm steam used to come up from the middle of the earth, and then when the earth got colder, and the column of steam froze and was turned into the North Pole, the dragon must have got frozen in his sleep—frozen too hard to move—and there he stayed. And though he was very terrible he was very beautiful too.
"
552,578,10,7,"Her pride could not tolerate the thought of being once more a nonentity in her class. To be held in high repute by her companions was the salt of life to her.

She knew perfectly well that she ought to walk out of the cupboard, confess to Mabel and the others that she had been listening to their talk, and explain the exact state of the case. It was the only straightforward course to take, and would prevent any further misconceptions. And yet, she hesitated. A swift and strong temptation had assailed her. After all, why need she tell? No one was aware that she had overheard this conversation, and nobody had so far made the slightest reference to her fictitious deed. 
"
553,579,4,8,"You have no idea how alarming it was, and at the same time how aggravating. The large-size dragons were terrible certainly, but once you had found out that the dragons always went to bed early because they were afraid of the chill night air, you had only to stay indoors all day, and you were pretty safe from the big ones. 
	But the smaller sizes were a perfect nuisance. The ones as big as earwigs got in the soap, and they got in the butter. 
	The ones as big as dogs got in the bath, and the fire and smoke inside them made them steam like anything when the cold water tap was turned on, so that careless people were often scalded quite severely. 
	The ones that were as large as pigeons would get into workbaskets or corner drawers and bite you when you were in a hurry to get a needle or a handkerchief. 
	The ones as big as sheep were easier to avoid, because you could see them coming; but when they flew in at the windows and curled up under your quilt, and you did not find them till you went to bed, it was always a shock. The ones this size did not eat people, only lettuce, but they always scorched the sheets and pillowcases dreadfully.
"
554,580,4,8,"When Gro came to the Witches' booths he found them guarded even as the Red Foliot had said, and the booths of them of Demonland in like manner. So went he into the royal booth where the King lay in state on a stand of spear-shafts, robed in his kingly robes over his armour that was painted black and inlaid with gold, and the crown of Witchland on his head. Two candles burned at the head of King Gorice and two at his feet; and the night wind blowing through the crannies of the booth made them flare and flicker, so that shadows danced unceasingly on the wall and roof and floor. On the benches round the walls sat the lords of Witchland sullen of countenance, for the wine was dead in them. Balefully they eyed Lord Gro at his coming in, and Corinius sat upright in his seat and said, ""Here is the Goblin, father and fosterer of our misfortunes. Come, let us slay him.""
"
555,581,4,8,"Its walls and pillars were of snow-white marble, every vein whereof was set with small gems: rubies, corals, garnets, and pink topaz. Seven pillars on either side bore up the shadowy vault of the roof; the roof-tree and the beams were of gold, curiously carved, the roof itself of mother-of-pearl. A side aisle ran behind each row of pillars, and seven paintings on the western side faced seven spacious windows on the east. At the end of the hall upon a dais stood three high seats, the arms of each composed of two hippogriffs wrought in gold, with wings spread, and the legs of the seats the legs of the hippogriffs; but the body of each high seat was a single jewel of monstrous size: the lefthand seat a black opal, asparkle with steel-blue fire, the next a fire-opal, as it were a burning coal, the third seat an alexandrite, purple like wine by night but deep sea-green by day. Ten more pillars stood in semicircle behind the high seats, bearing up above them and the dais a canopy of gold. The benches that ran from end to end of the lofty chamber were of cedar, inlaid with coral and ivory, and so were the tables that stood before the benches. The floor of the chamber was tessellated, of marble and green tourmaline, and on every square of tourmaline was carven the image of a fish: as the dolphin, the conger, the cat-fish, the salmon, the tunny, the squid, and other wonders of the deep. Hangings of tapestry were behind the high seats, worked with flowers, snake's-head, snapdragon, dragonmouth, and their kind; and on the dado below the windows were sculptures of birds and beasts and creeping things.
"
556,582,4,7,"In such ways Mivarsh fell asleep, clasping the egg as a man should clasp his dearest. And a little before dawn it hatched in his arms and fell asunder, and he started awake, his arms about the neck of a strange steed. It went forth into the pale light before the sunrise, and he with it, holding it fast. The sheen of its hair was like the peacock's neck; its eyes like the changing fires of a star of a windy night. Its nostrils widened to the breath of the dawn. Its wings unfolded and grew stiff, their feathers like the tail-feathers of the peacock pheasant, white with purple eyes, and hard to the touch as iron blades. Mivarsh was mounted on its back, seizing the shining mane with both hands, trembling. And now was he fain to descend, but the hippogriff snorted and reared, and he, fearing a great fall, clung closer. It stamped with its silver hoofs, flapping its wings, ramping like a lioness, tearing up the grass with its claws. 
"
557,583,4,8,"I found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner. I likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my arm-pits to my thighs. I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and the light offended my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me; but in the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back. 
"
558,584,4,8,"They conferred earnestly with each other, looking often upon me. At length one of them called out in a clear, polite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the Italian: and therefore I returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the cadence might be more agreeable to his ears. Although neither of us understood the other, yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the distress I was in. They made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the shore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised to a convenient height, the verge directly over me, a chain was let down from the lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to which I fixed myself, and was drawn up by pulleys.
"
559,585,4,8,"I ventured to address them in the following manner: “Gentlemen, if you be conjurers, as I have good cause to believe, you can understand my language; therefore I make bold to let your worships know that I am a poor distressed Englishman, driven by his misfortunes upon your coast; and I entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back, as if he were a real horse, to some house or village where I can be relieved. In return of which favour, I will make you a present of this knife and bracelet,” taking them out of my pocket. The two creatures stood silent while I spoke, seeming to listen with great attention, and when I had ended, they neighed frequently towards each other, as if they were engaged in serious conversation. 
"
560,586,4,8,"And the moment that Tonker touched the withered boards, the silence that, though ominous, was earthly, became unearthly like the touch of a ghoul. And Tonker heard his breath offending against that silence, and his heart was like mad drums in a night attack, and a string of one of his sandals went tap on a rung of a ladder, and the leaves of the forest were mute, and the breeze of the night was still; and Tonker prayed that a mouse or a mole might make any noise at all, but not a creature stirred, even Nuth was still. And then and there, while yet he was undiscovered, the likely lad made up his mind, as he should have done long before, to leave those colossal emeralds where they were and have nothing further to do with the lean, high house of the gnoles, but to quit this sinister wood in the nick of time and retire from business at once and buy a place in the country. Then he descended softly and beckoned to Nuth. But the gnoles had watched him through knavish holes that they bore in trunks of the trees, and the unearthly silence gave way, as it were with a grace, to the rapid screams of Tonker as they picked him up from behind—screams that came faster and faster until they were incoherent. And where they took him it is not good to ask, and what they did with him I shall not say.

Nuth looked on for a while from the corner of the house with a mild surprise on his face as he rubbed his chin, for the trick of the holes in the trees was new to him; then he stole nimbly away through the dreadful wood.

""And did they catch Nuth?"" you ask me, gentle reader.

""Oh, no, my child"" (for such a question is childish). ""Nobody ever catches Nuth.""
"
561,587,13,8,"His hands roamed desperately over the smooth, slimy stones lining the bottom of the well looking with mounting panic for any way out. But then his hand pushed against one of the rocks and it gave way– and with a rolling rumble, the ground below him gave way too.
"
562,588,4,8,"The sunrise coming up from the echoes, and the plains new-lit by the day, and the leagues spinning by like water flung from a top, and that gay companion, the loudly laughing wind, and men and the fears of men and their little cities; and, after that, great rivers and waste spaces and huge new hills, and then new lands beyond them, and more cities of men, and always the old companion, the glorious wind. Kingdom by kingdom slipt by, and still his breath was even. ""It is a golden thing to gallop on good turf in one's youth,"" said the young man-horse, the centaur. ""Ha, ha,"" said the wind of the hills, and the winds of the plain answered.
"
563,589,4,7,"The wind sighed, and the great tapers flared, and their obvious fear and the silence of the Sphinx grew more than ever a part of the atmosphere, and bats went restlessly through the gloom of the wind that beat the tapers low.

Then a few things screamed far off, then a little nearer, and something was coming towards us, laughing hideously. I hastily gave a prod to the door that they guarded; my finger sank right into the mouldering wood—there was not a chance of holding it. I had not leisure to observe their fright; I thought of the back-door, for the forest was better than this; only the Sphinx was absolutely calm, her prophecy was made and she seemed to have seen her doom, so that no new thing could perturb her.
"
564,590,13,8,"She sprayed down the slope of the high roof, clay tiles flying over the edge and shattering on the road below. Suddenly her feet simply ran out of roof and she only just managed to catch her handcuff chain on the gutter to keep from falling and shattering as well.

565,591,6,8,"Despite his young age, Amare had already ridden camels over almost every inch of the kingdom of Wagadu. Still, the camel he now sat upon, Feech, did not seem to know that or care– judging by the way he simply stopped whenever he pleased.

567,593,4,8,"	Two ancient warlocks walked together, squabbling with great ferocity and many extravagant hand gestures. Finally, one warlock, deciding he was not above it, stuck out a foot to trip his fellow. 
	""That’s the oldest trick in the book,” his fellow scoffed.
	""It absolutely is NOT!” replied the first, pulling forth a large and withered spellbook.

568,594,5,8,"	The goblin, always a rather considerate fellow (to those he deemed worthy), leaned over on his cane and considered the boy closely.

572,598,10,7,"Shelley reeeeally, REALLY, really did not want to go back to school this September. How could she sit in a neat row of desks in a classroom every day when all summer she had run free across the wilds of her Aunt Marta’s farm?
"
573,599,7,8,"The more I analysed the less I believed, and against my newly opened mind there began to beat grotesque and horrible analogies based on superficial aspects and upon my experience beneath the earth. Before I knew it I was uttering frenzied and disjointed words to myself: ""My God! . . . Molehills . . . the damned place must be honeycombed . . . how many . . . that night at the mansion . . . they took Bennett and Tobey first . . . on each side of us. . . .” Then I was digging frantically into the mound which had stretched nearest me; digging desperately, shiveringly, but almost jubilantly; digging and at last shrieking aloud with some unplaced emotion as I came upon a tunnel or burrow just like the one through which I had crawled on that other demonic night.

After that I recall running, spade in hand; a hideous run across moon-lit, mound-marked meadows and through diseased, precipitous abysses of haunted hillside forest; leaping, screaming, panting, bounding toward the terrible Martense mansion. I recall digging unreasoningly in all parts of the brier-choked cellar; digging to find the core and centre of that malignant universe of mounds. And then I recall how I laughed when I stumbled on the passageway; the hole at the base of the old chimney, where the thick weeds grew and cast queer shadows in the light of the lone candle I had happened to have with me. What still remained down in that hell-hive, lurking and waiting for the thunder to arouse it, I did not know. Two had been killed; perhaps that had finished it. But still there remained that burning determination to reach the innermost secret of the fear, which I had once more come to deem definite, material, and organic.

My indecisive speculation whether to explore the passage alone and immediately with my pocket-light or to try to assemble a band of squatters for the quest, was interrupted after a time by a sudden rush of wind from outside which blew out the candle and left me in stark blackness.

575,601,10,7,"Paulo sat on the edge of the pool with his legs dangling into the cool, bright blue water. He was NOT going to get in– because getting in meant taking his shirt off, and the thought of that made him feel like a hundred bees were swarming inside his chest.
"
576,602,7,8,"That I am still alive and sane, is a marvel I cannot fathom. I cannot fathom it, for the shadow on that chimney was not that of George Bennett or of any other human creature, but a blasphemous abnormality from hell’s nethermost craters; a nameless, shapeless abomination which no mind could fully grasp and no pen even partly describe. In another second I was alone in the accursed mansion, shivering and gibbering. George Bennett and William Tobey had left no trace, not even of a struggle. They were never heard of again.
"
577,603,5,8,"Once upon a time there was a wicked sprite, indeed he was the most mischievous of all sprites. One day he was in a very good humor, for he had made a mirror with the power of causing all that was good and beautiful when it was reflected therein, to look poor and mean; but that which was good-for-nothing and looked ugly was shown magnified and increased in ugliness. In this mirror the most beautiful landscapes looked like boiled spinach, and the best persons were turned into frights, or appeared to stand on their heads; their faces were so distorted that they were not to be recognised; and if anyone had a mole, you might be sure that it would be magnified and spread over both nose and mouth.
"
578,604,13,7,"Delilah slowly scanned the bleak, flat horizon, searching for a sign or signal. By now she knew enough to know that just because she couldn’t see it, didn’t mean it wasn’t there.
"
579,605,2,8,"How do we know how far a mile is? Or the exact size of a centimeter? If you were constructing a ruler, would you use another ruler to measure its notches? What if there was a mistake on the model ruler and all your “inches” actually measured 1.15 inches long– how would you know? A difference that small may not always matter, but it really does if you’re building a rocket, an airplane, or a bridge. That is why we have the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM).

The BIPM, located in France, holds the exact international standard for all base units of measurement: kilogram (mass), meter (distance), second (time), kelvin (temperature), ampere (electric current), candela (luminous intensity), and mole (quantity). Even the American imperial system can be measured back to these units! 

Originally, the international standards for each of these units was a specially crafted, physical object, known as a “human artifact”. To find out exactly how big a meter is, you could go deep into the BIPM vaults and see the carefully protected metal bar that was exactly 1 meter long. 

But there were problems with this system. Even though the artifacts were heavily protected, the objects still lost or gained microscopic amounts of material over long periods of time, changing the definition of that unit. And what if an accident ever took a chunk off that metal bar? It would still be, by definition, exactly 1 meter long, but measurements based upon it all over the world would be thrown into chaos!

That’s why we have now converted all standard measures to be defined by fundamental properties of the universe (like the speed of light and the movement of electrons), which will never alter or change. 
"
580,606,5,8,"A Flea, a Grasshopper, and a Leap-frog once wanted to see which could jump highest; and they invited the whole world, and everybody else besides who chose to come to see the festival. Three famous jumpers were they, as everyone would say, when they all met together in the room.

""I will give my daughter to him who jumps highest,” exclaimed the King; ""for it is not so amusing where there is no prize to jump for.”
"
581,607,2,8,"Most plants survive off sunlight, water, and the nutrients in the soil where they grow. But some plants live off of trapping and consuming bugs or small animals. These special varieties are called “carnivorous plants,” and they use many different techniques to catch their meals.

The Venus flytrap looks like a wide-open mouth, but its interior surfaces are covered with tiny sensitive hairs. If any intruder touches a hair twice within twenty seconds, the trap is triggered and the “mouth” snaps shut on its prey. 

The cobra lily’s leaves fill with water and lure small bugs in. However, its translucent, window-like leaves disguise the way out of the plant, leaving the bugs inside trapped and confused.

The many species of sundew all form small dewy orbs on the tips of their leaves to entice thirsty bugs. But rather than water, those drops are actually made of a sticky glue-like substance that holds the captured insect until the plant can digest it.

Perhaps most menacing of all is the pitcher plant, which can lure whole frogs to fall from their slippery leaves into the depths of their “pitcher” to drown. All that is left of these unfortunate frogs are their “slippers”: the discarded feet which are the only part of the frog the plant cannot digest.

582,608,5,7,"So they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees grew strangely into one another. There stood fine hyacinths under glass bells, and there stood strong-stemmed peonies; there grew water plants, some so fresh, others half sick, the water-snakes lay down on them, and black crabs pinched their stalks. There stood beautiful palm-trees, oaks, and plantains; there stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree and every flower had its name; each of them was a human life, the human frame still lived—one in China, and another in Greenland—round about in the world. There were large trees in small pots, so that they stood so stunted in growth, and ready to burst the pots; in other places, there was a little dull flower in rich mould, with moss round about it, and it was so petted and nursed. But the distressed mother bent down over all the smallest plants, and heard within them how the human heart beat; and amongst millions she knew her child's.

""There it is!” cried she, and stretched her hands out over a little blue crocus, that hung quite sickly on one side.

""Don't touch the flower!” said the old woman. ""But place yourself here, and when Death comes—I expect him every moment—do not let him pluck the flower up, but threaten him that you will do the same with the others. Then he will be afraid!”

583,609,2,7,"In the Earth’s solar system is the planet Saturn, and in Saturn’s orbit there are 62 moons. The largest of these moons is called Titan, and on Titan there are many strange seas. 

The largest of these seas is called Kraken Mare: its shorelines are burnt orange and this sea is not made of water. Instead, the seas and rivers of Titan are made up of methane and ethane which gather as clouds and then fall like rain to the surface. 

There is no liquid water on Titan, but it does appear there in its solid form: ice. Water on Titan only appears there as ice because its surface temperature is a chilly -290? (-179?)! Given this freezing climate, solid ice forms as large rocks– and occasionally as 4,000 foot high ice volcanoes! Scientists believe these volcanoes could be the key to finding possible evidence of life on Titan.

584,610,2,7,"You may know helium as the gas that makes balloons float and turns your voice to chipmunk mode. But what about helium as a liquid? When helium is cooled to -452? (-269?) it becomes a “superfluid”: a liquid that flows without friction.

In this superfluid state, helium can do some pretty unusual things. Superfluid helium can leak through cracks in a container that are only a single molecule wide! It will remain still even when its container is spun. Yet if it is started swirling, it will continue swirling forever! Perhaps most impressive of all, superfluid helium can resist gravity! Under the right conditions, it will flow against gravity, up and over the sides of its container!

585,611,2,8,"Mary Anning (1799-1847) was one of the world’s first scientists to collect and analyze dinosaur bones and fossils. Anning specialized in finding and preserving Jurassic fossils embedded in the cliffs of the English Channel. Landslides in that area often revealed fossils which had to be collected quickly before being destroyed by the sea. Anning proved skillful at this difficult and dangerous work. She was soon making discoveries that completely changed the study of prehistoric times. Among her greatest discoveries were: the first correctly identified ichthyosaur (<i>ick-thee-o-sore) </i>skeleton, two near complete plesiosaur (<i>plee-see-o-sore)</i> skeletons, and the first pterosaur (<i>tair-o-sore) </i>skeleton outside Germany. 

Sadly, during her lifetime, the Geological Society of London did not accept female members. Thus, Anning was rarely formally recognized for her work and research. Despite this, she was still well-known (and consulted), by scientists around the world.
"
586,612,2,8,"The microraptor was a kind of small, four-winged dinosaur that lived between the Jurassic and Cretaceous (<i>creh-tay-shus</i>) periods. The microraptor was around 3 feet in length, with a long feathered tail. Unlike any modern birds, the microraptor had wings with feathers on both arms and on both legs. 

Some scientists believe the microraptor lived in forest canopies, using its four wings to glide from tree to tree. It is unlikely that the microraptor spent much time on the ground. its long leg-feathers and tail would have made it difficult to walk. 

The microraptor's unique wing formation holds clues about its place in the chain of evolution. Some scientists believe that modern birds evolved from four-winged species into two-winged species. Other scientists believe the four-winged species were a strange variant that simply died out.
"
587,613,2,7,"When insects first appeared 400 million years ago, none of them could hear a thing. But, through evolution, many insect species have developed methods and anatomy for hearing. Hearing is a useful trait for insects to help them find food, avoid predators, and find mates. Many insects have ear structures based around an eardrum, just like humans. The major difference is where on the body these eardrums are found. Various insect species can have ears in all sorts of odd places: on their antennae, knees, legs, wings, abdomen, neck, or chest. Some moths and butterflies even have ears on their mouths!

589,615,2,7,"When walking through a forest, every tree and plant appears to stand on its own. Plants seem to compete for access to water, sunshine, and protection. But, below the surface, many plants within an ecosystem are involved in complex communications. Many of them even work together to help their neighbors thrive.

Research into the ""talk"" amongst trees has been expanding for several decades. There are still many unknowns in the field, but some facts are becoming clear: trees are able to warn others about oncoming threats like infestations or changing chemical levels; they are able to send excess carbon to seedlings in need of it; they can limit their root expansion to give young trees nearby a chance to grow; they are even able to recognize their own seedlings in a group. All of this happens through root systems and fungi beneath the soil! 

There is still much more to learn about how trees communicate. But so far, the research is really branching out in all directions!

593,619,3,7,"In Ancient Rome, days were divided up into 24 hours– just like ours. However, their days always consisted of 12 hours of light, and 12 hours of darkness. Since there is more or less daylight depending on the season, the length of an “hour” would adjust to match.

In 1324, Mansa Musa decided to journey to Mecca, the holiest of city’s for his Islamic faith. To accompany him on this religious journey (pilgrimage), Mansa Musa brought a large entourage: 60,000 people, 80 camels, and a vast quantity of gold. He spent a lot of gold in the cities he traveled through. He spent so much that he actually affected their economies! With so much gold flooding into the market, the price of gold went down– and the prices of everything else went up! Many historians note this as the only time a single person has controlled the price of gold. 
"
596,622,3,8,"The Inca Empire was a civilization that arose in South America between the 13th and 16th centuries. Though the Inca people did not have writing, they had other methods of recording information. One such method was the “quipu” (kee-poo). 

The quipu was a single long string with several other strings tied onto it. The shorter strings recorded categories and values. Information was conveyed through the different colors, styles, and number of knots tied into them. In fact, the word “quipu” means “knot.” Quipus were designed to keep close tallies on population size, tax records, and farming output. Quipus were kept and read by specially trained experts called “quipucamayocs.” When the Spanish invaded the Inca Empire, they banned the use of quipus. With no more living quipucamayocs, nobody knows exactly how to decode the complex counting system. Many scholars are still at work trying to decode the mysteries of the quipu.

"
599,625,3,8,"You probably know that ancient Egyptians wrote with hieroglyphs, but did you know the ancient Maya did as well? The Maya people developed their own complex system of writing called the Maya “script” or “glyphs.” This script was not based around an alphabet in the way English is. 

When writing in English, each one of the 26 letters in the alphabet represents a sound. To form words and sentences, we rearrange the order of those letters in groups. Instead of alphabetic, Maya glyphs are logographic and syllabic. “Logographic” means that each character or symbol represents an entire word or phrase. “Syllabic” means that some symbols represent whole syllables of a word, rather than just one sound. This combined system allowed for very detailed writing. They had three different ways to write “jaguar!”

Researchers have been able to decode the Maya script because so much of it was left behind. These glyphs have been found in many places: carved into Maya buildings and monuments, as well as painted in books and on pottery. So far scholars have identified over 800 unique Maya glyphs!
"
600,626,3,8,"Standardized testing has a very long history in China. It began as early as the Han Dynasty! By 165 BCE, passing an imperial exam was required for certain positions. These written tests were used to select hard-working government officials. The exams did not focus on knowledge related to a given position. Instead, most testing surrounded the teachings of Confucius (a philosopher of great importance to Chinese culture). Critics claim that the exams fostered conformity, rather than creativity. Supporters  say they promoted strong cultural unity and the virtue of education. Either way, the exams were incredibly rigorous.
	Testing took place over the course of three days. During these three days, examinees wrote the test in small cells. They also ate all their meals and slept in those cells. They were not allowed to communicate with their peers. Because pressure to pass was so high, some participants resorted to cheating. Some tried to bribe the examiners. Others wrote out cheat sheets on their underwear!
	The Chinese abolished imperial exams in 1905. However, the idea of standardized exams is still popular today.
"
601,627,3,8,"In 1633, Japan was being ruled by its final feudal government or ""shogunate.” Shogunates were led by a ""shogun”. a military dictator who held almost absolute power. At this time, the shogunate was run by the Tokugawa family clan. 
	Up to this point, Japan had been a rising attraction for foreign trade. Though global attention had some benefits, it also came with problems. Trade with other countries invited piracy, which flared along Japan’s coasts. It also sped the arrival of Catholicism from Spain and Portugal. European influence soon took root in the south of Japan, and was spreading. 
	The shogunate did not like this at all. They did not like the erosion of traditional Japanese culture. Perhaps more than that, they saw the colonial influence as a threat to their power. 
	The shogun in 1633, Tokugawa Iemitsu, took drastic action. In order to stop this ""cultural invasion,” he enacted a sakoku. a strict policy to isolate Japan from the rest of the world. The word ""sakoku” means ""closed country.” Under the sakoku, trade and migration were strictly limited. Most foreigners were not allowed into the country. Japanese nationals were not allowed out. The sakoku held for 220 years. 
	It finally came to and end in 1853 when American ""Black Ships"" sailed to Japan. They threatened force if trade was not reopened. One year later, a treaty was signed.

602,628,3,7,"The Olmecs were an ancient people that thrived between 1500 BCE and 400 BCE. They lived in the tropical region of modern-day Mexico. The Olmec people had a very rich society and culture: They had widespread systems of trade; They farmed maize, beans, and squash; They built basic aqueducts and pyramids; They were master sculptors; They had a complex religion with many rituals and gods. Their culture had a huge influence on later societies. And influence was all that was left– because the Olmecs disappeared.
	Around 400 BCE, the major Olmec cities were abandoned, and no one knows why. Many scholars agree that the environment was likely a major cause. Some believe that Olmec farming techniques left too much silt in their rivers. Others think that changes in climate or tectonic shifting affected their crops. Some experts say that an erupting volcano was the culprit! For now, the end of this great society remains a mystery.

603,629,3,8,"A ""griot” is a person in West African society similar to a minstrel: a storyteller, musician, poet, and historian. Though griots still exist and perform today, they date back as early as the Mali Empire in the 14th century. Griots held a vital role as the keepers of oral history through story and song. In this way, legends and histories would be passed down from one generation to the next. Certain praise songs could only be sung for people of the highest honor (often warriors or hunters). Given their vast knowledge of history, griots sometimes even acted as special advisors to royal families and rulers!

604,630,3,7,"The Empire of Ghana was a civilization that ruled over much of Western Africa between 300-1100 CE. Ancient Ghana was very wealthy, despite having no direct access to the most valuable resources of the time: gold and salt. Salt was in high demand for both flavouring and preserving food. In fact, salt was <i>so</i> valuable that it was literally traded for its weight in gold! 
	The mines north of Ghana produced salt, and the mines to the south produced gold. The clever rulers of Ghana saw an opportunity here: facilitate trade between the north and the south and reap all the rewards! The Empire of Ghana became the center of trade in the region, even extending its reach to trade across the Sahara Desert.

The emperor was charmed, and said the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round its neck. But the nightingale declined with thanks; it had already been sufficiently rewarded.

""I have seen tears in the eyes of the emperor; that is my richest reward. The tears of an emperor have a wonderful power! God knows I am sufficiently recompensed!” and then it again burst into its sweet heavenly song.

""That is the most delightful coquetting I have ever seen!” said the ladies, and they took some water into their mouths to try and make the same gurgling when any one spoke to them, thinking so to equal the nightingale. Even the lackeys and the chambermaids announced that they were satisfied, and that is saying a great deal; they are always the most difficult people to please. Yes, indeed, the nightingale had made a sensation. It was to stay at court now, and to have its own cage, as well as liberty to walk out twice a day, and once in the night. It always had twelve footmen, with each one holding a ribbon which was tied round its leg. There was not much pleasure in an outing of that sort.

He could read about everything which had ever happened in this world, and see it all represented in the most beautiful pictures. He could get information about every nation and every country; but as to where the Garden of Paradise was to be found, not a word could he discover, and this was the very thing he thought most about. His grandmother had told him, when he was quite a little fellow and was about to begin his school life, that every flower in the Garden of Paradise was a delicious cake, and that the pistils were full of wine. In one flower history was written, in another geography or tables; you had only to eat the cake and you knew the lesson. The more you ate, the more history, geography and tables you knew. All this he believed then; but as he grew older and wiser and learnt more, he easily perceived that the delights of the Garden of Paradise must be far beyond all this.

Not only were the colours and patterns unusually fine, but the clothes that were made of the stuffs had the peculiar quality of becoming invisible to every person who was not fit for the office he held, or if he was impossibly dull.

""Those must be splendid clothes,"" thought the Emperor. ""By wearing them I should be able to discover which men in my kingdom are unfitted for their posts. I shall distinguish the wise men from the fools. Yes, I certainly must order some of that stuff to be woven for me.""

He paid the two swindlers a lot of money in advance so that they might begin their work at once.

And there they sat like a king and queen under the sweet-scented tree, which still looked like an elder bush. Then he related to his old wife the story of the Elder-tree Mother, just as he had heard it told when he was a little boy, and they both fancied it very much like their own story, especially in parts which they liked the best.

Ole-Luk-Oie seats himself upon the bed as soon as they are asleep. He is nicely dressed; his coat is made of silken stuff, it is impossible to say of what color, for it changes from green to red and from red to blue as he turns from side to side. Under each arm he carries an umbrella. One of them, with pictures on the inside, he spreads over good children, and then they dream the most charming stories. But the other umbrella has no pictures, and this he holds over the naughty children, so that they sleep heavily and wake in the morning without having dreamed at all.

626,652,5,8,"Then they drove to the castle, in which were lofty halls and splendid drawing-rooms. Pure white curtains fluttered before the open windows, and beautiful flowers stood in transparent vases. In one of them, which looked as if it had been cut out of newly fallen snow, the apple branch was placed among some fresh light twigs of beech. It was a charming sight. And the branch became proud, which was very much like human nature.

People of every description entered the room, and according to their position in society so dared they to express their admiration. Some few said nothing, others expressed too much, and the apple branch very soon got to understand that there was as much difference in the characters of human beings as in those of plants and flowers. Some are all for pomp and parade, others have a great deal to do to maintain their own importance, while the rest might be spared without much loss to society.

So thought the apple branch as he stood before the open window, from which he could see out over gardens and fields, where there were flowers and plants enough for him to think and reflect upon—some rich and beautiful, some poor and humble indeed.

""Poor despised herbs,"" said the apple branch; ""there is really a difference between them and such as I am. How unhappy they must be if they could feel as those in my position do! There is a difference indeed, and so there ought to be, or we should all be equals.""
"
627,653,12,8,"Did you ever hear the story of the old street lamp? It is not remarkably interesting, but for once you may as well listen to it.

It was a most respectable old lamp, which had seen many, many years of service and now was to retire with a pension. It was this very evening at its post for the last time, giving light to the street. Its feelings were something like those of an old dancer at the theater who is dancing for the last time and knows that on the morrow she will be in her garret, alone and forgotten.

The lamp had very great anxiety about the next day, for it knew that it had to appear for the first time at the town hall to be inspected by the mayor and the council, who were to decide whether it was fit for further service; whether it was good enough to be used to light the inhabitants of one of the suburbs, or in the country, at some factory. If the lamp could not be used for one of these purposes, it would be sent at once to an iron foundry to be melted down. In this latter case it might be turned into anything, and it wondered very much whether it would then be able to remember that it had once been a street lamp. This troubled it exceedingly.
"
628,654,12,8,"During the whole day the Snow Man stood looking in through the window, and in the twilight hour the room became still more inviting, for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like the sun or the moon; it was only the kind of radiance that can come from a stove when it has been well fed. When the door of the stove was opened, the flames darted out of its mouth,—as is customary with all stoves,—and the light of the flames fell with a ruddy gleam directly on the face and breast of the Snow Man. ""I can endure it no longer,"" said he. ""How beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue!""
"
629,655,8,7,"""Cold winter is coming,"" said the swallow, ""and I am going to fly away into warmer countries. Will you go with me? You can sit on my back and fasten yourself on with your sash. Then we can fly away from the ugly mole and his gloomy rooms—far away, over the mountains, into warmer countries, where the sun shines more brightly than here; where it is always summer, and the flowers bloom in greater beauty. Fly now with me, dear little one; you saved my life when I lay frozen in that dark, dreary passage.""
	""Yes, I will go with you,"" said Thumbelina; and she seated herself on the bird's back, with her feet on his outstretched wings, and tied her girdle to one of his strongest feathers.
	The swallow rose in the air and flew over forest and over sea—high above the highest mountains, covered with eternal snow. Thumbelina would have been frozen in the cold air, but she crept under the bird's warm feathers, keeping her little head uncovered, so that she might admire the beautiful lands over which they passed. At length they reached the warm countries, where the sun shines brightly and the sky seems so much higher above the earth. Here on the hedges and by the wayside grew purple, green, and white grapes, lemons and oranges hung from trees in the fields, and the air was fragrant with myrtles and orange blossoms. Beautiful children ran along the country lanes, playing with large gay butterflies; and as the swallow flew farther and farther, every place appeared still more lovely.

"
630,656,12,8,"""You may have thousands of my days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry and happy. Does all the beauty of the world cease when you die?""

""No,"" replied the tree; ""it will certainly last much longer, infinitely longer than I can think of.""

""Well, then,"" said the little fly, ""we have the same time to live, only we reckon differently.""

 And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in its delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes laden with the fragrance from the clover fields and wild roses, elder blossoms and honeysuckle, and from the garden hedges of wild thyme, primroses, and mint. The perfume of all these was so strong that it almost intoxicated the little fly. The long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, that, when the sun sank, the fly felt tired of all its happiness and enjoyment. Its wings could sustain it no longer, and gently and slowly it glided down to the soft, waving blades of grass, nodded its little head as well as it could, and slept peacefully and sweetly. The fly was dead. 
"
631,744,4,6,"""What a curious feeling!"" said Alice. ""I must be shutting up like a telescope!""

And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.

After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.

632,745,4,5,"“Where is that Magic Belt?"" enquired the Wizard, who had listened with great interest.

 

""Ozma has it; for its powers won't work in a common, ordinary country like the United States. Anyone in a fairy country like the Land of Oz can do anything with it; so I left it with my friend the Princess Ozma, who used it to wish me in Australia with Uncle Henry.""

All she has to do is to say: 'I wonder what So-and-so is doing,' and at once the picture shows where her friend is and what the friend is doing. That's real magic, Mr. Wizard; isn't it?”
"
633,746,4,4,"""Have you guessed the riddle yet?"" the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.

""No, I give it up,"" Alice replied. ""What's the answer?""

""I haven't the slightest idea,"" said the Hatter.

""Nor I,"" said the March Hare.

Alice gave a weary sigh. ""I think you might do something better with the time,"" she said, ""than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers.""

""Take some more tea,"" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

""I've had nothing yet,"" Alice replied in an offended tone, ""so I can't take more.""

""You mean you can't take <i>less</i>,"" said the Hatter; ""it's very easy to take <i>more</i> than nothing.""
"
634,747,4,5,"Just then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of the horse tipping also. But they continued to fall, all together, and the boy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat, just as they were before. Then they turned bottom side up, and continued to roll slowly over until they were right side up again. During this time Jim struggled frantically, all his legs kicking the air; but on finding himself in his former position the horse said, in a relieved tone of voice:

 

""Well, that's better!""

 

Dorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder.

 

""Can your horse talk?"" she asked.

 

""Never knew him to, before,"" replied the boy.

 

""Those were the first words I ever said,"" called out the horse, who had overheard them, ""and I can't explain why I happened to speak then. This is a nice scrape you've got me into, isn't it?""

 

""As for that, we are in the same scrape ourselves,"" answered Dorothy, cheerfully. ""But never mind; something will happen pretty soon.""

 

""Of course,"" growled the horse; ""and then we shall be sorry it happened.
"
635,748,4,5,"The Sorcerer, hearing the laugh, looked toward the little girl with cold, cruel eyes, and his glance made her grow sober in an instant.

 

""Why have you dared to intrude your unwelcome persons into the secluded Land of the Mangaboos?"" he asked, sternly.

 

""'Cause we couldn't help it,"" said Dorothy.

 

""Why did you wickedly and viciously send the Rain of Stones to crack and break our houses?"" he continued.

 

""We didn't,"" declared the girl.

 

""Prove it!"" cried the Sorcerer.

 

""We don't have to prove it,"" answered Dorothy, indignantly. ""If you had any sense at all you'd known it was the earthquake.
"
636,749,4,6,"The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it. ""I wish they'd get the trial done,"" Alice thought, ""and hand 'round the refreshments!""
"
637,750,4,4,"""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?""

""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Toy Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.""

""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit.

""Sometimes,"" said the Toy Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.""

""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?""

""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Toy Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""
"
638,751,4,5,"“What do you think you’re doing?” a muffled voice spits at the pixies from behind. 

Fidget and Wink struggle to their feet in the shimmering pile of crystals, but neither are brave enough to turn around and face the source of the voice. 

“Wink, please tell me your voice has gotten deeper,” Fidget squeaks. 

“I’m afraid to look,” whispers Wink, with his hands over his eyes. 

Fidget spins around slowly and sees a long claw-like toenail. Her face is almost level with the goblin’s knees, which are caked black with dirt. She is close enough to smell the cheesy stench coming from his feet. Taking a few steps back, Fidget looks up at the old goblin. Her knees are shaking. 

“I don’t care for pixies above the ground,” sneers Grimblerod, “but I will not stand for them snooping around in my home.” 
"
639,752,4,2,"They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the time their noses twitched.

""Why don't you get up and play with us?"" one of them asked.

""I don't feel like it,"" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain that he had no clockwork.

""Ho!"" said the furry rabbit. ""It's as easy as anything,"" And he gave a big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs.

""I don't believe you can!"" he said.

""I can!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I can jump higher than anything!"" He meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to say so.

""Can you hop on your hind legs?"" asked the furry rabbit.

That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other rabbits wouldn't notice. 
"
640,753,4,5,"“What do you think you’re doing?” a muffled voice spits at the pixies from behind. 

“Wait, Larque, before you go... what will happen if Asgall gets into Coraira?” Lochlan asks.

“I suspect he will destroy Calla. And without a successor, without Calla, magic will cease to exist.”

“When you find Asgall, will you kill him?” asks Lochlan. 

“If only it were that easy,” Larque says.

Leaving the Caines with their heads full of questions, Larque states,“Regelo!” and walks into the scene of Coraira. Around Lochlan and Gwendolyn, the air ripples again. 

Coraira disappears. Rhyme appears as it did before. Except that the robin is no longer there. 
"
641,754,4,3,"""You must have your old Bunny!"" she said. ""Fancy all that fuss for a toy!""

The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands.

""Give me my Bunny!"" he said. ""You mustn't say that. He isn't a toy. He's REAL!""

When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that what the Toy Horse had said was true at last. The nursery magic had happened to him, and he was a toy no longer. He was Real. The Boy himself had said it.

That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a look of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next morning when she picked him up, and said, ""I declare if that old Bunny hasn't got quite a knowing expression!""
"
642,755,4,5,"But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.

As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and Dorothy heard a voice say:

""I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?""

It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head; so she took courage and answered:

""I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.""
"
643,756,4,4,"She examines a softly snoring Wink. The rusty-haired pixie is snuggled beneath a dirty wool cloth on a mossy napping nook. There is a stack of dried rose petals under his head and his red cap sits beside him. His face is hidden beneath a layer of dust. Thick, white cobwebs coat every surface in the cubby hole, stretching down over the viewing window and across the sleeping pixie. Fidget notices the fresh rose petals she’d laid down for her own pillow before she fell asleep are now brown and crumbly. 

“That was some nap!” she declares as she stretches her arms and scratches her head. Dust coats her white braids and her fingers. “Wink!” she squeals. “I think it’s time to get up!” 
"
644,757,4,5,"Asher turns to see hundreds of drops of golden light floating lazily, midair in the centre of the room. He and Elora approach the dreamy spectacle as the drops of light slowly drift together, creating a swirling column of bright light stretching from the floor to the towering black ceiling. The column grows thicker as it twists silently, around and around. Elora and Asher look at each other when the twisting stops. Where the light was, a shimmering spiral staircase remains. 

The soft squeak of their footsteps breaks the silence as the pair approaches the stairs. 

“Do we climb it?” Asher wonders aloud. 

<i>“Yes,” </i>goads the disembodied voice. Elora’s eyes widen.Asher lifts his foot to take a step. 

“Wait!” Elora cautions. “What if the voice is leading us to some sort of trouble?” 

Asher laughs. “You do realize, you will grow up to be the most cruel witch there ever was. What could you possibly be afraid of?” He takes the first step. 

Elora winces. “Why must you keep reminding me of that?” 

“Hello?” he calls, louder this time. “Who is there?”

Elora reluctantly follows him.
"
645,758,4,5,"Ariana has never before encountered an animal that’s tried to harm her. <i>Something is happening, </i>she thinks, swatting yet another bat away as it nips her shoulder. <i>Is someone... or something after us?</i> She reaches for her brother’s hand. As soon as her hand clasps around Asher’s, the twins feel a jolt of electricity and see a flicker of blue light. They stare at their hands for a moment and then notice the sound has faded. The bats are gone. 
"
646,759,4,5,"The sea witch is there, looking just like she did in her parents’ memory. The octopus around her waist takes on the purple colours of her scales. 

“You’ve brought her!” the witch says gleefully, swimming away from her vanity. “you’ve brought me the girl!” 

<i>Easy, lady, </i>Teagan thinks as she watches the witch toss aside what appears to be a crystal ball. The octopus catches it. 

<i>Follow Naleah’s lead, </i>she tells herself, nervously clutching the bag crossing her body. <i>Stay cool. </i>
"
647,760,4,4,"The ground shakes. The stone figure of Elora begins to crack. A great moan comes from deep within Elora, louder than a clap of thunder. The twins cover their ears. Gwendolyn and Lochlan throw their arms around Ariana and Asher. Sibley, Cinnamon, Fidget, and Wink are at their feet.  

 

Colours move across the starry night sky. Pink, green, and yellow. Aurora Borealis adding to the drama of the night’s events. The statue crumbles and Elora rises from the earth. She stands at least seven feet tall, but she continues to grow taller. And taller. Against a background of northern lights. 

 

A great cackle comes from her throat. “Fooooools!” she cackles. 

 

“Oh Asher,” Ariana cries, “what have we done?”
"
648,761,4,4,"Teagan swims past a giant mirror. <i>Oh my goodness, was that me? </i>she exclaims, going back to study her reflection in one of countless looking glasses coating the rock. 

Teagan puts her hands at her hips and on the shimmering black scales of her tail. <i>I’m gorgeous! </i>Her eyes are bluer than they were when she was a human. Her hair has grown thicker, and her white streak is more pronounced and more silver than white. 
"
649,762,4,5,"Every time Marigold asks her mother or father where the quilt came from, she’s given a different answer: “It’s what you were wrapped in when you were delivered by the stork!” or, “It took us years to steal enough pairs of human underwear to sew that for you!” or, “It grows a new patch by itself each year!” 

She doesn’t ask about the blanket anymore. But, she imagines it was sewn by someone who loves her. 
"
650,763,4,5,"""John, how can you expect sick people to come and see you when you keep all these animals in the house? It’s a fine doctor that would have his parlor full of hedgehogs and mice! That’s the fourth personage these animals have driven away. Squire Jenkins and the Parson say they wouldn’t come near your house again—no matter how sick they are. We are getting poorer every day. If you go on like this, none of the best people will have you for a doctor.”

""But I like the animals better than the ‘best people,” said the Doctor.

""You are ridiculous,” said his sister, and walked out of the room.
"
651,764,4,3,"""Now listen, Doctor, and I’ll tell you something. Did you know that animals can talk?”

""I knew that parrots can talk,” said the Doctor.

""Oh, we parrots can talk in two languages—people’s language and bird-language,” said Polynesia proudly. ""If I say, ‘Polly wants a cracker,’ you understand me. But hear this:<i>Ka-ka oi-ee, fee-fee?""</i>

""Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. ""What does that mean?”

""That means, ‘Is the porridge hot yet?’—in bird-language.”

""My! You don’t say so!” said the Doctor. ""You never talked that way to me before.”

""What would have been the good?” said Polynesia, dusting some cracker-crumbs off her left wing. ""You wouldn’t have understood me if I had.”

""Tell me some more,” said the Doctor, all excited; and he rushed over to the dresser-drawer and came back with the butcher’s book and a pencil. ""Now don’t go too fast—and I’ll write it down. This is interesting—very interesting—something quite new. Give me the Birds’ A.B.C. first—slowly now.”
"
652,765,4,4,"So it was agreed that the monkey, Chee-Chee, was to do the cooking and mending; the dog was to sweep the floors; the duck was to dust and make the beds; the owl, Too-Too, was to keep the accounts, and the pig was to do the gardening. They made Polynesia, the parrot, housekeeper and laundress, because she was the oldest.

Of course at first they all found their new jobs very hard to do—all except Chee-Chee, who had hands, and could do things like a man. But they soon got used to it; and they used to think it great fun to watch Jip, the dog, sweeping his tail over the floor with a rag tied onto it for a broom. After a little they got to do the work so well that the Doctor said that he had never had his house kept so tidy or so clean before.
"
653,766,4,5,"He eats his breakfast in silence. He’s grown used to the quiet but it still bothers him. He doesn’t remember the last time he heard the sound of his own voice. 

After he finishes eating, he washes his cup and plate in soapy water. He then grabs his fishing gear and walks outside. He hears nothing but for the soft snores of the sleeping giants, which include his parents. It sounds like the low rumble of distant thunder. 

Every day, he looks off to the horizon, where he can see the enormous forms of his family. He’s stopped hoping for the day when they will wake, for, after more than a hundred years, hope is a hard thing to muster. 
"
654,767,13,5,"And then he awoke to find the howling real. There was a great snarling and yelping. The wolves were rushing him. They were all about him and upon him. The teeth of one had closed upon his arm. Instinctively he leaped into the fire, and as he leaped, he felt the sharp slash of teeth that tore through the flesh of his leg. Then began a fire fight. His stout mittens temporarily protected his hands, and he scooped live coals into the air in all directions, until the campfire took on the semblance of a volcano.
"
655,768,12,3,"Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were— Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter. They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree.

“Now my dears,” said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, “you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor. Now run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out.”
"
656,769,10,5,"Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as she looked she saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil. It was something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up. It was more than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time.

Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it hung from her finger.

""Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,"" she said in a whisper. ""Perhaps it is the key to the garden!""
"
657,770,13,6,"An hour went by, and a second hour. The pale light of the short sunless day was beginning to fade, when a faint far cry arose on the still air. It soared upward with a swift rush, till it reached its topmost note, where it persisted, palpitant and tense, and then slowly died away. It might have been a lost soul wailing, had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness. The front man turned his head until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind. And then, across the narrow oblong box, each nodded to the other.

A second cry arose, piercing the silence with needle-like shrillness. Both men located the sound. It was to the rear, somewhere in the snow expanse they had just traversed. A third and answering cry arose, also to the rear and to the left of the second cry.

""They’re after us, Bill,” said the man at the front.
"
658,771,12,4,"Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.

Presently Peter sneezed—”Kertyschoo!” Mr. McGregor was after him in no time. And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work.

Peter sat down to rest. He was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can. 
"
659,772,10,3,"""How still it is!"" she whispered. ""How still!""

Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his tree-top, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.

""No wonder it is still,"" she whispered again. ""I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.""

She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid of awakening some one. She was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.

""I wonder if they are all quite dead,"" she said. ""Is it all a quite dead garden? I wish it wasn't."" 
"
660,773,4,4,"This time the kite rose straight in the air and remained steady. The boy with the ball of twine unwound it until the kite and Raggedy Ann were way, way up and far away. How Raggedy Ann enjoyed being up there! She could see for miles and miles! And how tiny the children looked!

Suddenly a great puff of wind came and carried Raggedy Ann streaming way out behind the kite! She could hear the wind singing on the twine as the strain increased.

Suddenly Raggedy Ann felt something rip. It was the rag to which she was tied. As each puff of wind caught her the rip widened.
"
661,774,12,4,"He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.

An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.

Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some goldfish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.
"
662,775,4,6,"It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive.

""I ran as fast as I could,"" he said, sitting down and yawning, ""but the flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?""

Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:

""I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as mice have saved my life. How strange it all is!"" 
"
663,776,4,6,"	""It is a cave,"" said Kathleen.
	""The young explorers,"" explained Gerald, blocking up the hole of entrance with his shoulders, ""dazzled at first by the darkness of the cave, could see nothing.""
	""Darkness doesn't dazzle,"" said Jimmy.
	""I wish we'd got a candle,"" said Kathleen.
	""Yes, it does,"" Gerald contradicted—""could see nothing. But their dauntless leader, whose eyes had grown used to the dark while the clumsy forms of the others were bunging up the entrance, had made a discovery.""
	""Oh, what!"" Both the others were used to Gerald's way of telling a story while he acted it, but they did sometimes wish that he didn't talk quite so long and so like a book in moments of excitement.
	""He did not reveal the dread secret to his faithful followers till one and all had given him their word of honour to be calm.""
	""We'll be calm all right,"" said Jimmy impatiently.
	""Well, then,"" said Gerald, ceasing suddenly to be a book and becoming a boy, ""there's a light over there—look behind you!""


"
664,777,4,5,"One day the dolls were left all to themselves.

Their little mistress had placed them all around the room and told them to be nice children while she was away.

And there they sat and never even so much as wiggled a finger, until their mistress had left the room.

Then the soldier dolly turned his head and solemnly winked at Raggedy Ann.

And when the front gate clicked and the dollies knew they were alone in the house, they all scrambled to their feet.

""Now let's have a good time!"" cried the tin soldier. ""Let's all go in search of something to eat!"" 
"
665,778,10,4,"""Dickon,"" she said. ""You are as nice as Martha said you were. I like you, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I would like five people.""

Dickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when she was polishing the grate. He did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his round blue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.

""Only five folk as tha' likes?"" he said. ""Who is th' other four?""

""Your mother and Martha,"" Mary checked them off on her fingers, ""and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff.""

Dickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting his arm over his mouth.

""I know tha' thinks I'm a queer lad,"" he said, ""but I think tha' art th' queerest little lass I ever saw."" 
"
666,779,4,3,"Just as their mistress came into the room the dolls dropped in whatever positions they happened to be in.

""This is funny!"" cried Mistress. ""They were all left sitting in their places around the room! I wonder if Fido has been shaking them up!"" Then she saw Raggedy Ann's face and picked her up. ""Why Raggedy Ann, you are all sticky! I do believe you are covered with jam!"" and Mistress tasted Raggedy Ann's hand. ""Yes! It's JAM! Shame on you, Raggedy Ann! You've been in the pantry and all the others, too!"" and with this the dolls' mistress dropped Raggedy Ann on the floor and left the room.
"
667,780,10,3,"""CAN girls help to mend engines?” Peter asked doubtfully.

""Of course they can. Girls are just as clever as boys, and don't you forget it! How would you like to be an engine-driver, Phil?”

""My face would be always dirty, wouldn't it?” said Phyllis, in unenthusiastic tones, ""and I expect I should break something.”

""I should just love it,” said Roberta—"" do you think I could when I'm grown up, Daddy? Or even a stoker?”

""You mean a fireman,” said Daddy, pulling and twisting at the engine. ""Well, if you still wish it, when you're grown up, we'll see about making you a fire-woman. I remember when I was a boy—”

Just then there was a knock at the front door.

""Who on earth!” said Father. ""An Englishman's house is his castle, of course, but I do wish they built semi-detached villas with moats and drawbridges.”
"
668,781,4,6,"Something white moved under a weeping willow; white hands parted the long, rustling leaves. A white figure came out, a creature with horns and goat's legs and the head and arms of a boy. And Gerald was not afraid. That was the most wonderful thing of all, though he would never have owned it. The white thing stretched its limbs, rolled on the grass, righted itself, and frisked away across the lawn. Still something white gleamed under the willow; three steps nearer and Gerald saw that it was the pedestal of a statue—empty.

""They come alive,"" he said; and another white shape came out of the Temple of Flora and disappeared in the laurels. ""The statues come alive.""
"
669,782,10,3,"“What's that he's saying?” asked the farmer, heavily.

“Sounds like French to me,” said the Station Master, who had once been to Boulogne for the day.

“It isn't French!” cried Peter.

“What is it, then?” asked more than one voice. The crowd fell back a little to see who had spoken, and Peter pressed forward, so that when the crowd closed up again he was in the front rank.

“I don't know what it is,” said Peter, “but it isn't French. I know that.” Then he saw what it was that the crowd had for its centre. It was a man—the man, Peter did not doubt, who had spoken in that strange tongue. A man with long hair and wild eyes, with shabby clothes of a cut Peter had not seen before—a man whose hands and lips trembled, and who spoke again as his eyes fell on Peter.
"
670,783,10,4,"“Mother, would you mind if we didn't have the buns for tea tonight, but on the fifteenth? That's next Thursday.”

“<i>I</i> don't mind when you have them, dear,” said Mother, “but why?”

“Because it's Perks's birthday,” said Bobbie; “he's thirty-two, and he says he doesn't keep his birthday any more, because he's got other things to keep—not rabbits or secrets—but the kids and the missus.”

“You mean his wife and children,” said Mother.

“Yes,” said Phyllis; “it's the same thing, isn't it?”
"
671,784,4,5,"“You are brilliant! How could I have forgotten about that?” 

“Your brain is probably frozen solid,” Ariana quips. “Can you still reach the stone?” 

Asher removes a mitten and uses his red-knuckled hand to dig into his coat pocket. “Got it!” he announces. 

“Good,” Ariana says. “Now see if it works.” 

Asher nods as he closes his eyes and places the frigid green stone to his forehead. Heavy snowflakes drift onto his long blond eyelashes and the thick fur of his hood. 

Ariana rubs her fingers together within her mittens and quietly chants in a whisper, “Please let this work, please let this work...” 
"
672,785,4,4,"The sun has given itself to the horizon. There’s not a breath of wind to move the millions of green leaves on the tree. The air is getting colder, but there’s a warmth coming from her pendant. It grows warmer as she gets closer to the tree. 

Hypnotized by the colours in the stone, Teagan doesn’t notice that her shoelace has come untied. She steps on the lace and trips, stumbling to the ground. Instinctively, she puts out her hand to brace herself against the tree. But her hand doesn’t stop. It goes through the tree. 
"
673,786,4,5,"All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.
"
674,787,13,5,"One Eye moved impatiently beside her; her unrest came back upon her, and she knew again her pressing need to find the thing for which she searched. She turned and trotted back into the forest, to the great relief of One Eye, who trotted a little to the fore until they were well within the shelter of the trees.

As they slid along, noiseless as shadows, in the moonlight, they came upon a run-way. Both noses went down to the footprints in the snow. These footprints were very fresh. One Eye ran ahead cautiously, his mate at his heels. The broad pads of their feet were spread wide and in contact with the snow were like velvet. One Eye caught sight of a dim movement of white in the midst of the white. His sliding gait had been deceptively swift, but it was as nothing to the speed at which he now ran. Before him was bounding the faint patch of white he had discovered.

675,788,4,5,"""Come along,"" said the Princess hospitably. ""I couldn't find anything but bread and cheese—but it doesn't matter, because everything's magic here, and unless you have some dreadful secret fault the bread and cheese will turn into anything you like. What would you like?"" she asked Kathleen.

 

""Roast chicken,"" said Kathleen, without hesitation.

 

The pinky Princess cut a slice of bread and laid it on a dish. ""There you are,"" she said, ""roast chicken. Shall I carve it, or will you?""

 

""You, please,"" said Kathleen, and received a piece of dry bread on a plate.

 

""Green peas?"" asked the Princess, cut a piece of cheese and laid it beside the bread.

 

Kathleen began to eat the bread, cutting it up with knife and fork as you would eat chicken. It was no use owning that she didn't see any chicken and peas, or anything but cheese and dry bread, because that would be owning that she had some dreadful secret fault.

676,789,4,5,"There are trees all around, but they are faded in colour. Everything is faded. She can see the colours the plants and trees should be, but the colours are drab, muted shades, like in photographs in Joan’s old family albums. 

She stands and faces the tree behind her, which looks different than it did in Caine Park. Its bark is silvery grey, but there are no carvings on it. She reaches out and cautiously touches the solid trunk. <i>Maybe if I fall again, it will snap me out of this, </i>she thinks. <i>Unless I’m dead. </i>

677,790,4,4,"“As you know, giants are a peaceful race. We have the largest hearts of any other being in any realm. Our empathy is our greatest power and our greatest weakness.” 

“What do you mean?” Frederick asks. 

“Giants have the ability to feel the human condition,” his father explains. “When the humans feel happy, we feel joy. When the humans feel despair, we feel sorrow. When the humans feel anger, we feel rage. We need to sleep for a hundred years to rest and repair our hearts from the ache.”

678,791,4,5,"In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened. Well, not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their manners.

""I—want—you—to—get—into—the—nest,” the bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible ""and—then—you—can—drift—ashore, but—I—am—too—tired—to—bring—it—any—nearer—so—you—must—try to—swim—to—it.”

""What are you quacking about?” Peter answered. ""Why don't you let the nest drift as usual?”

""I—want—you—” the bird said, and repeated it all over.

Then Peter tried slow and distinct.

""What—are—you—quacking—about?” and so on.

The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.
"
679,792,7,7,"Dina saw a group of girls that seemed to be about her age sitting on top of a picnic table at the other end of the park. They were all turned away from her, apparently looking at something of great interest in the distance that she couldn’t make out. One sat cross-legged leaning back on her hands, her shiny hair cascading down her back. Another rested her elbows on top of her bent knees, gently picking at her nail polish. They lounged gracefully in their effortless jeans. Cool girls. 

Dina took a deep breath and squared her shoulders. She was feeling like a new woman recently– why not be a cool girl? As she walked towards them with an increasingly moisture-less mouth, she tried to decide if it was better if they noticed her approaching, or if she just appeared out of nowhere beside them. Suddenly both options seemed unavoidably and horrifyingly awkward. Luckily it didn’t seem to matter because not one of the girls turned their head so much as a fraction of an inch as Dina drew nearer. They were definitely focused on something, it seemed, but it wasn’t her. 

After what seemed like at least an hour (but must have been only a couple of minutes), Dina finally arrived at the picnic table. She had snapped some particularly crunchy twigs underfoot in her last few steps, but still nobody looked around. 

Feeling more and more panicked and insane for having put herself in this bizarre position with a bunch of strangers, Dina finally found her (suddenly very tremulous) voice. “Hi hello I’m Dina where– what are you all looking at?”

Nothing.

“Uh, I hang out here a lot but I’ve never noticed you here before, do you, uh, go to parks a lot? I mean, this one? ‘Cause like, um, like I said I haven’t seen you here and I’m here like pretty much all the time, or like, a normal amount of time.” 

Still nothing. 

Dina stared into the intricate twin braids lining the back of one of the girls’ heads. She was getting really frustrated now and could feel the nervous anticipation turning to anger in her throat. Why did these girls think they were so much better than her anyway? As if she didn’t deserve even a single moment of their precious attention? Where exactly did they get off with that– they didn’t even know her! 

Dina stormed around the picnic table to look at them– no, to force <i>them</i> to look at <i>her</i> just for one minute, and to listen. But when she came around to the other side of the table she stopped dead. Her mouth hung open and had gone bone dry once more. 

Standing on that side of the table, she stared in horror at that same pair of intricate twin braids. The girls hadn’t moved– Dina hadn't taken her furious gaze off of them– yet somehow she was looking at the back of their heads again. But their bodies were still turned towards her! It was all so grotesque and somehow she could still read the phrase on the front of one of their tshirts: <i>Say it again and I’ll pretend like I care.</i>

680,793,4,5,"A moment after the fairy's entrance, the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried Tinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust.

“Tinker Bell,” he called softly, after making sure that the children were asleep, “Tink, where are you?” She was in a jug for the moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.

“Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my shadow?”

The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.
"
681,794,7,7,"From the living room window on the fifth floor I can see 156 windows in the apartment building across the street– I’ve counted. Some of those windows might as well not be there at all, since the drapes are always shut too tight to see much of anything anyway. I like them best in the evenings, when each little square is a glowing different colored portal into another world. It's like watching TV but all of the channels are spread out beside each other all at once. There’s the woman in the midnight blue square who does yoga in the evenings while her cat watches. There’s the young couple in the orange square always trying to keep both small kids at the dinner table at once. There’s the really old man in the mustard yellow square with the television flickering behind him as he stares out the window all night long. 

But then there’s the green square. It’s more of a green sliver, actually. The shade is usually pulled almost all the way down so there’s just a skinny rectangle of deep emerald light pouring out. Sometimes strange shadows cross that rectangle of light. Shadows that move like liquid but seem to be solid. Shadows that are perfectly still for hours and then disappear in the blink of an eye. Shadows that seem to know that I’m watching. I know it sounds crazy... but I think they can feel me.

683,796,9,7,"In Mayan mythology there is a bat god named Camazotz. In the cultures Camazotz came from, bats represented night, death, and sacrifice. Legend says that Camazotz was in the House of Bats when the Maya Hero Twins had to journey through it in the underworld. The cave was so full of bats that the Twins had to hide themselves inside their own blow dart tubes to stay safe. After many hours, one of the Twins stuck his head out of the tube to see if it was safe to come out, but Camazotz flew down and chomped his head right off! Then, adding insult to injury, Camazotz brought the head to a ballgame to be used as the ball!

684,797,9,7,"In Greek mythology, Pandora was a beautiful woman that the mighty god Zeus had made out of clay. Pandora was given many beautiful gifts, including one box that was locked tight. Zeus didn’t tell her what was inside, but told her that she was not to open it under any circumstances. One day Pandora’s curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box. All the worst and darkest forces came streaming out: Hate, Envy, Illness, Death. Pandora tried to shut the lid again but it was too late, its contents had been released into the world forever. Most versions of the story say that Hope was inside that box too. Some say Hope was the only thing left trapped in the box when Pandora shut the lid again. Others say that Hope escaped too, and is the only thing we have to fight against those dark forces.

686,799,11,7,"The Farakkas Council sat around the exquisitely carved circular table wearing grave faces. At least, the parts of their faces not completely obscured by long shaggy grey hair looked grave. Beads of milky liquid clung to the dark red rock of the low ceiling and trickled down the rough walls. In the hollow center of the table, a human baby lay sleeping. A delicate forcefield of shimmering light cloaked it like a second skin. 

<i>Earth creatures cannot survive longer than a couple of days in our lands</i>, one member of The Council thought. <i>How did this small and unformed one get here?</i>

<i>And what in the name of Kukumao are we meant to do with it now</i>, another replied.

687,800,7,7,"Melinda crept after the thing, careful to avoid the creaky places in the old wooden floorboards. It limped hunchbacked along in front of her, snorting and snarling and dragging its dead arms behind. Then a nail caught her arm and, before she could stop herself, she let out a gasp.

688,801,11,7,"Marieke knew it would be a significant risk, but after all, what great discoveries had ever been made without a little risk? She knew that the science behind her hypothesis was unshakable, because she had researched it herself. She had double and triple checked the theory and the data. She must have performed hundreds of experiments of all kinds before now– but there was something definitely different about being the subject of the experiment. It gave her a whole new respect for guinea pigs.

Nonetheless she turned on her LabCam and noted the time in her log book: 24/05/19 16:04. The camera’s red light started blinking below the dark, staring lens. It was like a timer counting down to lift off. 

Now or never.

Marieke took a deep breath, switched on the accelerator, and stepped onto the landing pad. A high whine filled her ears. Then– CRACK!

“Yeah that’s what I just said, dummy, so now you can ignore people talkin’ to ya both in real life and at the pictures! What a treat!” Marie scoffed, throwing him a dirty look that was forgotten a moment later. “Say, but it surely would be neat to see all those screen stars really saying somethin’ for a change though– don’t you think? Almost like it’s not just a picture or a story, but like somethin’ altogether real! Like they’re really standin’ right there and everything!”

699,812,7,7,"Deep in the dank, dark cave, the Lizard King smiled horribly down at David. Thick, clotted globs of dried blood clung to its many needle-like teeth (each one about as tall as David himself). The air in the cramped space was choked with the musty, rotted smell of the beast’s hot breath. 

David took a step backwards, dumbfounded by where all his searching had led him and wishing more than anything that he had never started looking in the first place. But before he could turn to run, the scaly tip of a gargantuan tail thudded down behind him blocking his way. 

David stared up into the Lizard King’s face once more. Dozens of smaller, bonier lizards were crawling all over it. Fine, fiery circles of gold encircled the wide black holes of its pupils. David looked into those merciless eyes and knew he would never see the sunlight again.

Ainsley threw it as hard as she could against the opposite wall, accomplishing little besides stripping off a few chips of chartreuse paint. Mauro fiddled around impressively with a bent coat hanger for a while until finally giving up and admitting that he didn’t know how to pick locks. 

“How are we supposed to get into that stupid thing?” Ainsley fumed.

“We could light it on fire,” Mauro suggested looking ponderous. The others raised their eyebrows.

“Why would we?” Val asked. “We’d destroy whatever’s inside and then we’d never find out.”

“Still,” Mauro replied, “don’t you kinda get the feeling that this weird old box is the only piece of wood on Earth that somehow wouldn’t burn?”

I’ve never seen them, but sometimes late at night I hear the car (a red five-seater just like ours) rumble out of their drive. Sometimes I press my nose against my bedroom window and try to see inside that house. Sometimes I see a boy standing there, staring out from the house’s second floor window with bloody handprints smeared around him. Just like ours.

They climbed a few more steps and then Tamera came to a stop so sudden, it nearly sent Nik tumbling all the way back down to the landing. 

“WHAT THE H–” Nik blurted, but Tamera covered her mouth with her free hand. 

She pointed the flashlight’s beam down onto the few stairs just ahead of them. They were covered in a thick layer of dust disturbed in only two places: the first stair had the print of a woman’s left shoe; the stair above that had a print of a woman’s right shoe; but the stairs above that had no prints at all. And none leading back down, either.

“My mother doesn’t approve one bit of all these people setting up electric lights in their homes these days,” she said. “She finds the way that people simply trip over themselves in their haste to forget the worthy old ways we’ve always done things is simply vulgar. I must say I quite agree with her.” 

She glanced at Bonnie out of the corner of her eye to make sure her statements were producing the right effect. However, Bonnie was staring off over the fields with a thoughtful expression in her eyes.

“I suppose that newness for its own sake can indeed be vulgar,” she mused, unaware of Charlotte’s annoyed countenance. “But I would argue that retaining oldness for its own sake is just as bad.”

709,822,12,8,"The Line 1 Toronto train was a subway like many others you’ve seen. He rocketed down Yonge Street, around the Union loop, and rattled off towards Vaughn. At Vaughn he'd let out a loud, hissing sigh and a clanking sort of grunt, then reverse and do the whole thing backwards all over again. He liked his transit union job well enough, but he couldn’t help thinking about the lights at the end of his tunnels. No matter how long he'd been running, or how much he wished for anything else, that little hopeful point of light always turned out to be just one more dirty subway platform.

It is said that he was the child of the sun god, Inti, and the moon goddess, Mama Killa. According to legend, Inti sent Manco Cápac to Earth with a magical golden staff and instructed him to find the place where the staff sunk into the ground. On that spot, he was to build a Temple of the Sun, honoring his father. Manco Cápac travelled with his siblings until they found the spot, and there they built the temple, founding the city of Cusco. Some versions of the story claim that in order to secure his position as the ruler of Cusco, Manco Cápac turned all three of his brothers to stone!

Some historians believe the legends of Manco Cápac were exaggerated stories based on a real person. Others think they were simply myths that glorified the origins of the Inca people.

One such occupant was the curly-haired man she had seen above deck earlier. There were three others at the table, but he had his arm around a woman wearing diamond earrings and a smirk. 

As Priscilla watched, the woman reached nonchalantly down towards her high-heeled shoe. Slowly and discreetly, she pulled something out of it.

And then he awoke to find the howling real. There was a great snarling and yelping. The wolves were rushing him. They were all about him and upon him. The teeth of one had closed upon his arm. Instinctively he leaped into the fire, and as he leaped, he felt the sharp slash of teeth that tore through the flesh of his leg. Then began a fire fight. His stout mittens temporarily protected his hands, and he scooped live coals into the air in all directions, until the campfire took on the semblance of a volcano.

One Eye moved impatiently beside her; her unrest came back upon her, and she knew again her pressing need to find the thing for which she searched.

It might have been a lost soul wailing, had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness. The front man turned his head until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind. And then, across the narrow oblong box, each nodded to the other.

A second cry arose, piercing the silence with needle-like shrillness. Both men located the sound. It was to the rear, somewhere in the snow expanse they had just traversed. A third and answering cry arose, also to the rear and to the left of the second cry.

""They’re after us, Bill,” said the man at the front.

Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep. The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. ""Spring has forgotten this garden,” they cried, ""so we will live here all the year round.” The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver.

944,1057,13,6,"Passage 1: <b>Digging</b>
Every night that week Mustafa had woken up to the same sound. He would be lying still in his soft bed, when suddenly the loud <i>CLANG</i> of metal on metal would make his eyelids shoot open in a jolt. Then came the sounds of digging. The soft shuffle and hiss of dirt being spilled over dirt, again and again.

The first time it had happened, Mustafa woke up confused and on edge in the dark. Once he realized that he had just been startled out of a dream, he relaxed a little and rolled over, ready to go back to sleep. But then he heard the digging coming from outside his window. 

Mustafa’s bedroom was on the first floor of their apartment building, and its window faced out into a beautiful gated courtyard. All the other apartment buildings looked into that courtyard and it was filled with trees, and flower beds, and wooden benches. During the daytime, the courtyard would be filled with little kids running around, and older folks sitting in the shade to read. But at night it was filled with nothing but shadows, and the tall black metal gates that surrounded it were firmly shut, chained, and locked.

At first Mustafa just lay there on his side, gazing out of his window, listening. He had never heard more than the mewling of a cat in the courtyard at night, and this was definitely no cat. From where he lay, he could just see the sharp pointed black tips of the gate glinting in the silvery moonlight, and all of the dark, dark night sky beyond. The sound of the digging continued steadily: a jab, a muffled patter of dirt, a low whispering sound as it scattered and slid.

Mustafa knew Joseph, the man who tended the trees and gardens in the courtyard. He knew that Joseph obsessed over his gardens, and only ever dug in them during the day because he believed that plants liked peace at nighttime, just like people. He also knew that Joseph was the only person with the keys to the courtyard gate. So, who was this digging in the courtyard in the middle of the night? And what were they digging for?

Mustafa no longer felt like going back to sleep. He didn’t think he could have if he tried. His heart was starting to beat a little louder in his chest, and he noticed that the hand gripping his blanket was sweaty. Slowly, he pulled the blankets back and slid out of his bed. He crawled across the floor to the window, not wanting his head to be seen. He paused just below it and crouched, listening.

<i>Jab, patter, whisper; jab, patter, whisper</i>– was it getting faster? Mustafa took a deep breath, held it, and inched his head up to peer through the bottom of the window. 

Fifteen feet from where Mustafa knelt, through the gate and across the grass was a large pit in the ground. Mounds of black earth were piled all around it, and a vivid orange glow was coming from its unseen depths. Closest to Mustafa were a couple of objects covered in dirt. The first was a large tattered book, leather-bound, but too filthy to read the title of. The other was a headdress of some kind, or a crown. Its metal was carved with detailed markings and it had jewels or stones embedded all across its surface. As Mustafa stared out at it, his widening eyes reflecting both the pale moon and the strange orange light, he finally let out his breath in a gasp as he realized: set into the crown were not jewels, or stones, but hundreds and hundreds of human teeth.

Suddenly a slow creaking sound rose up from the bottom of the pit and Mustafa ran back to his bed and jumped under the covers. Turning his back to the window he tried to steady his breath which was coming hard and fast. He tried closing his eyes, willing himself to go back to sleep and awake to find this had all been a terrible dream, but every time his eyelids closed the image of the crown was there waiting for him. Even under the blankets on that warm night, Mustafa lay there shivering for a long time before he finally fell asleep.



The next morning Mustafa rose slowly, sitting up and letting the smoky scent of bacon wash over him pleasantly before even opening his eyes. Once they were open, he blinked dully at a shadow on his wall, a shadow cast by the pointed tips of the metal courtyard gate.

And suddenly, with a feeling like an icy stone falling into his stomach, he remembered. Nearly tripping over his own feet in his hurry to reach the window, when he got there he breathed a deep shuddering sigh of relief. He even let out a little laugh. 

Looking out into the sunny courtyard, everything was just as it should be. A man with a coffee cup was on a bench reading a magazine. A woman and her small daughter were having a tickle fight under a large oak tree. No pit. No orange light. No crown. 

<i>What a terrifying dream that was! </i>Mustafa thought to himself. <i>I’ve really gotta cool it on those late-night movies Mom hates. Maybe there is such a thing as too-vivid an imagination.</i>

And he went to go have breakfast with his family.



That night Mustafa yawned and leaned back into his pillows, already wondering what his dad might be making for breakfast the next day when he gently drifted off to sleep. 

Then he heard a <i>CLANG</i>, followed by the unmistakable sounds of digging.

It caught the toe of his boot as he passed and he went tumbling through the crooked trees.

""And do you think,” said master sternly, ""that treatment like this will make him fond of your will?”

""He had no business to make that turn; his road was straight on!” said the man roughly.

""You have often driven that pony up to my place,” said master; ""it only shows the creature's memory and intelligence; how did he know that you were not going there again? But that has little to do with it.

""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?""

""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Toy Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""

949,1062,12,4,"Passage 1: <b>The Coat Woman</b>
Where I come from, there is only one very old story. This story has been handed down from mother to daughter and from father to son. Nobody knows when it was first told. Perhaps it has <i>always</i> been told. It is the story of the Coat Woman. 

People say that the Coat Woman lives deep in the dark forest. Some people say she lives in the heart of a tree. Others say that she sleeps under the river. Only a very few souls have actually seen her. Or at least, only a few have been able to come back and tell about it.

She is tall. Very tall, for a woman (if that is what she is). She has dark glossy hair. The top half of her face is as pale as the moon. Nobody has ever seen the bottom half. It is always covered by the large collar of her great and mysterious coat. 

She is never seen without the coat. It seems to be too big for her. It falls all the way down to her feet and drags on the ground behind her. The sleeves are wide and sweeping. It is always said to be made of some thick, heavy material, but the color is disputed. Some people say the coat looks dark and soft like moss. Others say it is as pale and layered as the fog. One rare tale tells of the coat glowing like the light reflecting off a cat’s eye in the night.

But what is on the outside of the coat is less troubling than what lies on the inside. Some people think she has no body at all. The woman never speaks, but strange sounds come from under that coat: the calls of birds that don’t exist, the howling of strong winds, a chime that reminds you of something you lost in childhood. Nobody knows what is under her coat. Nobody wise wants to know. So if you ever see her in the deep, dark forest, don’t let your curiosity get the best of you. Or else the Coat Woman might get the best of you too. 


Passage 2: <b>Abbatha</b>
In a very small village in a very small house, there once lived a young girl. The girl’s name was Abbatha, and she was also very small. Abbatha was so small that people often didn’t notice her. Sometimes she got stepped on in the market. Sometimes she got chased by kittens.

One evening Abbatha was standing on the windowsill, sweeping. Then, along came a wicked old man. All at once he plucked Abbatha from the windowsill, put her in his coat pocket, and hurried away. Abbatha screamed and yelled to be let out, but no one could hear her. Then she noticed a teeny tiny hole in the corner of the pocket. She held her breath and squeezed through. Just as she was about to swing down to the ground and run home, she had an idea. She was going to teach that wicked man a lesson.

Abbatha climbed back up the seams of the old man’s coat. She climbed up until she was standing right on top of the coat collar. Then she jumped up onto the brim of his hat. Abbatha was so light and small, that the old man had no idea what had happened. Then Abbatha leaned over the hat’s edge and whispered into his ear.

""This is the voice of your heart speaking,” she said. She tried to make her voice sound serious and impressive. ""You have done a bad deed. You must pay for what you have done.”

The old man stopped in his tracks and turned around. ""Who said that?” he cried. 

Passage 3: <b>The Fig Tree</b>
?Have you ever read a beautiful story about bear puke and dynamite? No? Well then get yourself ready, because that’s exactly what this is. Beautiful stories about bear puke and dynamite used to be very popular. Now, sadly, they are quite rare. It’s funny the way trends come and go. But now is not the time to think of the old days– there is a story to be told. And a very beautiful one at that.

Once, a long long time ago, there was a cave. Inside that very cave, there was a bear. And that bear is the vomiting hero of our story– but not quite yet. You see, the bear was in the cave for a strange and sad reason. The bear had wandered far from its home lands. He had become separated from his mother in the woods, and then had gotten lost. And on top of everything else, now he was being hunted (by a hunter). So, in an attempt to lose the hunter, the bear hid inside that cave.

The bear sat very still and silent, but soon the hunter approached. He couldn’t see the bear, but he knew he was in there. So, like the very reckless hunter he was, he came up with a very reckless plan. The hunter lit the fuse of a stick of dynamite and threw it into the cave! <i>BANG</i>! The dynamite exploded in every direction! Chunks of rock flew off the cave ceiling! Everything was covered in a huge thick cloud of dust. Thinking that he would come back for the bear’s body when the dust had settled, the hunter left.

But the bear was not dead. The bear was not even hurt! What the bear was, was scared. So he puked. Then, shaken, but happy to have escaped, the bear left the cave too (in the other direction).

So inside that cave there lay a puddle of bear puke. And inside that bear puke was a fig that the bear had eaten back home. And inside that fig was a seed. A fig seed. So there the fig seed lay in the puddle of puke on the dirt floor of that cave.

And in the ceiling of that cave was a hole. A hole that had been blown out by the dynamite. And inside that hole there was sunlight. In fact, that little hole let a golden sunbeam right into the middle of the cave. And that sunbeam landed right in the middle of that puddle of bear puke. Right on top of the fig seed.

So years went by, and little by little, the fig seed grew. It grew and grew into a beautiful fig tree, right inside that cave! And the tree began to grow figs of its own. And every once in a while, that same bear would come by for a snack.

You see, the bear loved figs. He had eaten them all the time at home. But there were no fig trees here in this strange land. None except the one in the cave. So sometimes he came back for a nibble. But he always kept an eye out for that reckless hunter.

Then one day another bear came walking through those lands. She had walked a very long way. She was looking for her baby bear. She had walked for years and years in search of her baby. And now that mama bear was feeling very hungry. That’s when she spotted a fig tree up in the distance. She walked over to it. And as she walked, she thought how strange it was to see a fig tree in these lands. But she was happy, because they reminded her of home. 

As she sat and ate some figs, another bear approached the tree. 

Her baby! 

The two bears hugged beneath the tree. They ate as many figs as they could, and headed back home together. Neither one of them ever saw that reckless hunter again. But as they walked off through the forest, they stepped over a hunter's cap that was smoking slightly on the ground.

""Roast chicken,"" said Kathleen, without hesitation.

The pinky Princess cut a slice of bread and laid it on a dish. ""There you are,"" she said, ""roast chicken. Shall I carve it, or will you?""

""You, please,"" said Kathleen, and received a piece of dry bread on a plate.

""Green peas?"" asked the Princess, cut a piece of cheese and laid it beside the bread.

Kathleen began to eat the bread, cutting it up with knife and fork as you would eat chicken. It was no use owning that she didn't see any chicken and peas, or anything but cheese and dry bread, because that would be owning that she had some dreadful secret fault.

Passage 2: <b>Captain Critter</b>

""Please just get it out of here,” Wyatt’s dad called from the bathroom. ""You know the rules. Nothing with more than four legs in the apartment.”

""Fine,” Wyatt huffed. ""But I don’t get why it’s always my job. You trapped the thing! How come I have to take it out?”

""It’s about being a team player, hon,” came his dad’s reply. Wyatt could hear him washing his hands again. ""Molly found it in the sink. And she, uh, raised the alarm.” Wyatt could still hear her sobbing in the next room. ""I chased it around and trapped it. It almost took some of me with it, too. Now you just have to bring it downstairs and set it free. Everyone does their part.”

""Ugh, fine. Here I go!” Wyatt called. ""But if I’m not back in five minutes, call the fire department. Tell them it ate me alive! On your orders!”

Wyatt kneeled down. He lowered his face to the level of the glass. Trapped inside was a big, disgusting centipede. It was crawling all over. Its creepy little legs were wiggling like crazy. 

""Gross,” said Wyatt. Then he took a deep breath.

Wyatt slid a take-out menu under the glass. He was careful not to leave room for the bug to crawl out. Then he picked up the glass– menu, bug, and all. Holding it at arm’s length, he walked out the front door.

Wyatt’s family lived in an apartment building. All the windows had screens on them. And they lived on the 11th floor. That meant that Wyatt had to bring the bug all the way down to the lobby just to let it out. Wyatt reached the elevators.

He had one hand on the menu under the cup. His other hand was planted firmly on top of the cup. He was NOT going to let that thing get out until they were outside. But it left him no hands for the elevator button. He crouched down and pressed it with his elbow.

""You’re just lucky you didn’t end up in a bug-crushing household,” Wyatt told the bug. ""My dad doesn’t like to kill things. Even gross-out things like you. I guess I don’t either. But I don’t like being your personal driver much better.”

The elevator dinged and Wyatt got in. Using his elbow again, he pushed the button for ""lobby”. He looked into the cup. The centipede was racing around inside. It crawled up the sides and back down again. It ran around and around. 

""Wow, you’re fast!” Wyatt said. ""You must be pretty scared, huh? I would be pretty scared if I was you. Some weird looking giant traps me in a tank and runs off with me? Yeah I’d say that’s nightmare fuel for sure.”

Wyatt watched the floor numbers light up as the elevator went down. 9...8...7. He looked into the cup again. He brought it a little closer to his face. The centipede had stopped running. It was standing on the side of the glass. Its long skinny antenna waved slowly back and forth.

Wyatt laughed. ""It looks like you’re waving at me!” he said. ""Helloooo in there!” Wyatt tilted the glass a little. The centipede didn’t move. ""It’s cool that you can crawl up walls,” he said. ""I wish I could do that. Then you could see the whole world upside down! With that plus your speed, you’d make a good superhero. We could call you Captain Critter!”

The elevator rumbled down a few more floors. 4...3...2. Wyatt had a strange feeling. He was almost at the lobby. He was almost done with this gross, icky job. But he felt sad. He didn’t want to lose Captain Critter. 

The elevator dinged again. The doors slid open. They had reached the lobby. Wyatt could see the big glass doors to the street. But he didn’t step out. 

No, Wyatt crouched again and pushed the number 11 button with his elbow. The doors slid shut. Wyatt looked at Captain Critter and smiled. His dad was not going to be happy about his new pet.

His bare feet beat dust clouds out of the ground. The sun was hot on the back of his neck. The air smelled like dirt, fish, and spices, just like always. As he ran he looked back over his shoulder. All he could see were cloth market stalls, wooden carts, and people, people, people!

People haggling for lower prices. People arguing over a clay pot. People yelling friendly hellos to each other. The hundreds of voices surrounded Yao like flapping birds. Just then Yao spotted the one person in the crowd he was dreading. Thinking fast, he dove into a large woven basket and ducked down. Keeping as low as he could, he peeked over the basket edge. 

The chicken vendor walked slowly through the crowd. He had an ugly snarl on his face. His hands were clenched into fists. He looked left and right, searching for a glimpse of Yao. But slowly, eventually, he was past the place where Yao was hiding. Yao let out a sigh of relief. 

The smell of fish was very strong all of a sudden. Yao moved his foot against something squishy. He looked down and saw hundreds of glassy dead fish eyes staring back at him! Of all the baskets in the market, he’d had to jump into this one.

His stout mittens temporarily protected his hands, and he scooped live coals into the air in all directions, until the campfire took on the semblance of a volcano.

She raised her hand to ask Mrs.Crenlaw if she could go, but when she opened her mouth all she could say was “Can I... bathroom? I’m gonna–” She burped loudly and shut her mouth tight again to stop anything else from coming out. Forgetting about permission, Esme jumped up and ran for the door. Sprinting towards the girls’ bathroom, she kept one hand covering her mouth just in case. As she reached the door and shoved it open she thought: <i>Why does every word for throwing up make it sound like you’re actually throwing up when you say it?</i> <i>Hurl, barf, vomit, spew…</i>

Before she could answer herself she felt a terrible gurgling from her stomach. She wrenched open one of the stall doors and stepped inside. She stared down into the toilet water and tried to take a deep breath. <i>Gross!</i> She thought. <i>I knew I should have never let Georgia talk me into that stupid gummy worm eating contest. But Georgia can’t be feeling too great either, she must have eaten twice as many as me!</i>

Just then there was the creak of the bathroom door opening and a slam from the stall door on Esme’s right. Esme heard a small burp and bent lower to see the shoes in the next stall. Just as she thought, she saw a pair of bright blue sneakers with red racing stripes. 

“Hey Georgia,” Esme said. “At least we’re in this togeth–” But Esme wasn’t sure that Georgia heard the rest of it over the wet splash from the next stall.

960,1073,10,5,"Passage 1: <b>Jeremy and the Wishing Stars</b><br>Jeremy lived in a very tall building, in the middle of a very large city. At night, he could see all kinds of twinkling lights through the window of his twenty-third floor apartment. But Jeremy couldn’t see a single star in the sky.

When Jeremy was very young, his mother had taught him to say, <i>“Star-light, star-bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight.”</i> But whenever he gazed up at the night sky, even if he concentrated with with all his might, he couldn’t see a single star.

Jeremy’s mother explained that the lights of the city are so bright that the stars fade into the background, and become very difficult to see. “But then how do kids in the city make wishes?” Jeremy asked. His mother thought about it for a while, and then said, “You just have to be a little more creative.”

After that, Jeremy began finding stars all over the place. But instead of looking up, towards the empty night sky, he gazed down at the city, through his twenty-third floor window. The city, he found, was actually full of stars, after all. You just have to be a little more creative.

Jeremy made wishes on the blinking lights of airplanes, and on the blinking lights on the tops of tall buildings. He made wishes on the headlights of cars on the freeway (although these were more like shooting stars). And he made wishes on the lights of the city streets, on windy nights, when the treetops danced with the lampposts far below his twenty-third floor window.

Jeremy decided that he was actually pretty lucky to live in the city. “The city is so big and the sky is so small,” he thought to himself. For the little patch of sky that he could see between the tall buildings looked no bigger than a postage stamp. Jeremy figured that there were definitely more stars in the city than you could possibly fit into that tiny patch of sky.

Then, one day, Jeremy’s mother announced that his family was going on a camping trip in the country. Jeremy didn’t like the sound of that idea one bit. He had lived in the city his whole life, and had never been to the country. He didn’t want to leave his twenty-third floor apartment, and all of the twinkling stars of the city.

But, no matter how much he whined, and no matter how much he begged, his mother would not listen. “You’ve never been to the country,” she said. “How do you know you’re not going to like it?” But Jeremy was sure that there was nothing in the country that he would like more than the city.

The next day, they packed up the car and drove off to the country. Jeremy sat in the back seat with his arms crossed and sulked the whole way. They passed lots of trees and farms, and more trees and more farms, and the occasional house along the road.

One farm that they passed had a bunch of cows standing in a field. Jeremy’s mom said, “Hey look! Cows! You’ve never seen cows before, have you?” But Jeremy just continued to sulk. “Big deal,” he said. “You can see cows anytime on milk cartons.”

Another farm had horses, and his mom said, “Hey look, Jeremy! Horses! You’ve never seen those before either!” But Jeremy continued to sulk. “So what,” he said. “You can see horses anytime on TV.”

Finally, they arrived at their campsite and unpacked their things. Jeremy tried to set up his tent but it just turned into a big mess. The sheet got all tangled, the poles wouldn’t fit, and Jeremy got frustrated and sulked <i>even more</i>.

Then, they went for a walk in the woods and Jeremy got bitten by every mosquito. The bites left itchy red bumps all over his body, which his mother told him not to scratch. And Jeremy got frustrated and sulked <i>even more</i>.

Then, it started to rain and their clothing got soaked. They ran back to camp and put on dry things. But Jeremy still felt damp and uncomfortable. He was now very frustrated and sulked <i>even more!</i>

For dinner, they just had cooked hot dogs on sticks and baked potatoes wrapped in tin foil. Jeremy’s mom said, “It’s fun to cook on an open fire!” But Jeremy didn’t think that it was fun at all.

He was cold, and he was itchy, and very, <i>very</i> frustrated! Jeremy stood up and yelled at his mom, “I hate the country! I just want to go home!” Then he turned away from the campfire and stomped back toward his tent.

But away from the campfire, it was very dark, and Jeremy couldn’t see where he was going. His foot slipped on a patch of fresh mud and Jeremy fell straight backwards onto the cold, wet ground.

This should have made Jeremy even more frustrated – and it would have – <i>except</i> that at that very moment, when Jeremy opened his eyes, something amazing happened.

For the first time, when Jeremy looked up at the night sky, he could see stars, as far as the eye could see. And not just a few stars either. Hundreds of stars! Thousands of stars! Millions of stars! Zillions of stars! More stars than you could possibly imagine. “All of the lights in all the cities of the world would not be enough to fill a sky so big,” thought Jeremy. “It would take you a hundred lifetimes to wish on all of those stars!”

Then, Jeremy closed his eyes and concentrated with all his might on a very important wish. He looked up at the stars, twinkling above, and said, <i>“Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish, I wish tonight…”</i>

Afterwards, he continued to lie there, gazing up at the sky for several minutes. Finally, his mother called him from the campfire saying, “Jeremy, are you alright?”

“I’m fine,” said Jeremy with a smile on his face. Maybe the country wasn’t so bad after all.

A few days later, Jeremy’s family packed up their bags and drove back to the city.

That night, Jeremy looked out of his twenty-third floor window, as usual. But, instead of looking down at the lights of the city below, he looked up at the patch of night sky above him. A big grin appeared on Jeremy’s face when he saw that his wish had actually come true.

For there, in that small patch of sky, he could see a single star twinkling away. And when Jeremy saw it, he remembered that somewhere, way up high, above the tall buildings around him, there was a giant sky full of twinkling stars. And they were shining brighter than the lights of any city. 
<br><br>Passage 2: <b>Shaking Everest</b><br><b><i>May 12, 2015</i></b>

<b><i>11:45 AM </i></b>

<b><i>Mt. Everest Base Camp (Nepal)</i></b>

 

The food isn’t horrible, but it definitely isn’t my mom’s cooking. I just finished my lunch, this mushy mixture of rice and lentils called Dal Bhat. It seems like this is on the menu every single day. Now I am sipping a mug of warm Nepali tea. Before arriving in Nepal, I never even liked tea. Here, everyone drinks tea. Even kids.

I may only be 12-years-old, but now I’m just as hooked on this delicious beverage as everyone else in Everest Base Camp. 

My dad and I arrived in base camp one month ago, in mid April. I’d been dreaming about this trip for the past five years. When I was seven-years-old, I saw a television show about a boy named Jordan Romero, who became the youngest person in the world to climb Mt. Everest at only 13.

I told my dad I wanted to do that. Not just to do it. To beat his record. 

Most dads would laugh, but my dad is not like most dads. An experienced mountaineer himself, he was a member of the Seven Summits Club. That means that he has climbed the highest peaks on all seven continents. He became a member a few years before I was born, when he climbed Everest for the first time. Since then, he’d climbed Everest two more times, both on the Chinese side and Nepal side of the mountain.

It was five years of dreaming and preparation, but here I was, right at the bottom of the tallest mountain on the entire planet. Technically, I was too young to even try climbing it. It was very dangerous - people died every year trying to make it to the top. Last year they ended the climbing season early when a block of ice the size of a mansion came roaring down the mountain. The avalanche killed 16 guides, mostly Sherpas, and out of respect almost everyone left the mountain days later. 

Since the climb was so dangerous, you were supposed to be 16-years-old, but Dad knew I was ready. I climbed more peaks than many of the adults trying to go up this year. Dad also worked for the U.S. government and had a lot of connections with the Napalese. Somehow he made it happen. 

Finishing the last drops of my tea, I left the mug with Tensing, who was the expedition cook. He was also the coolest Sherpa on the mountain.

“Tensing, have you seen my dad?” I asked.

“No, dude. No dad here.”

Tensing was a member of the Sherpa tribe, a tribe that lived in the Khumba valley surrounding Everest. Without the help of the Sherpa people, trips to the top of the world would be impossible. Sherpas were a major part of any expedition to Everest, helping with everything from cooking to climbing.

Tensing also liked to call me <i>dude</i> for some reason. I was from Maine, where no one said dude, but Tensing thought every American kid said dude. I think he watched too many old American TV shows.

“Dude, eat. Eat more food,” Tensing said in broken English, his big toothy smile making me grin. “I make big feast today.” 

“No thank you,” I said, rubbing my stomach. “I’m stuffed. I’m going over to see Pemba. Please tell my dad where I am if he comes by.”

“Okee dokee, dude. If hungry later. Come eat.”

“Thanks. See you in a bit.”

I pulled aside the big yellow flap that covered our mess hall tent, and immediately pulled down my sunglasses. Even though it was cold enough to need a coat and hat, the sun was bright, which made you want to take off your hat and coat. It didn’t really make sense, but at 17,598 feet above sea level, a lot of weather things were strange around here. Even at base camp, we were higher up than every mountain in North America except Mount McKinley in Alaska, which I climbed last year. I would have been the youngest to climb it, but Jordan Romero was one month younger than me when he reached its peak!

 Everest Base Camp was so high up that we had to spend 10 days hiking just to get used to the high altitude. If you tried to go up too high too fast you could get really sick.

I saw Pemba sitting down on a rock, a few tents away. Pemba was one of the climbing sherpas with our expedition. He was also really good at soccer. 

Everest Base Camp was really just a giant tent city that only existed during its short climbing season each spring. The rest of the year the weather was too unpredictable to attempt a climb. It was full of large expeditions like ours that had big tents to hang out in and even watch movies, and tiny one-person tents for people trying to climb the mountain by themselves.

Pemba had been teaching me a few soccer moves over the past few weeks, but the ground was so rocky here that it wasn’t easy. It was also hard to play soccer for too long because the high altitude made you get tired very quickly.

“Pemba, wanna play soccer?” I yelled.

I felt dizzy for a moment and almost fell down. It felt like the ground was shaking.

Pemba looked up at me and smiled, but then quickly turned his head away toward the sound.

I heard it, too. 

Everyone did. 

It sounded like a cross between a giant tree snapping in half and a bomb exploding.  

Almost instantly, the boom progressed into a low rumble, almost like that of an oncoming train.

I looked at Pemba. His eyes were wide with fear. 

“Avalanche!” he screamed. “Run!”

Now the source of the sound was clear. A massive cloud appeared from the top of the mountain next to Everest, and it was coming straight at me.

<br><br>Passage 2: <b>Queen Dreck</b><br>Once upon a time there was a very evil queen. Her name was Queen Dreck. Queen Dreck didn’t care about her subjects one bit. She cared about them even less than she cared about the little children in the orphanage (which was not very much at all). She forced servants to lie down in mud puddles to keep her shoes clean. She bragged to the poor about the feasts she ate. She often kicked puppies out of her way! She was greedy. She was mean. Nobody in the whole kingdom liked her. But there was nothing they could do!

Queen Dreck had the magic crown. Whoever had the magic crown got to rule the kingdom. Nobody knew how she got it. Some people think that she stole it from the last Queen’s daughter. Others think that she stole the daughter’s whole head! However she got it, she wasn’t ever going to give it up. Many people had tried to take it from her. Everybody had failed.

Queen Dreck was as sneaky as she was evil. She was good at keeping the magic crown safe. She walked everywhere with strong armed guards. The castle was protected by a moat of flame. When she slept, she held the crown to her chest. She always slept lightly, ready to attack any thieves. That was bad news for thieves, because Queen Dreck was a master of karate.

Queen Dreck was sneaky, but Wigaldo the Wizard was smarter. Wigaldo lived in the castle too. The Queen used him to make poisons for her enemies. But Wigaldo was done with all that now. He only had one last poison to make. And it was for Queen Dreck! Wigaldo crafted a poison that would put the queen in a deep deep sleep. Then he could snatch the crown! 

He made the poison and mixed it into a pot of tea. Just as he was about to leave with it, he had an idea. With one small fix, his plan was ready. He took the tea to Queen Dreck’s bedroom.

“Your Majesty, Queen Dreck, I have your bedtime tea,” he said.

“I see,” said Queen Dreck, raising her eyebrows. “But why have you made it for me, Wigaldo? I usually make the blind maid do it. I like to see her spill the hot tea on herself as she tries to climb the stairs.”

“I was in the kitchen when it was ready, Your Majesty,” Wigaldo said, thinking quickly. “It was my honor to bring it here to you.”

“I see,” Queen Dreck said again. “This isn’t a trick, is it, Wigaldo? I hate tricks. Unless they’re mine. I think you should drink the tea first. Just to make sure there is nothing wrong with it. You wouldn’t want anything bad to happen to your Queen. Would you?”

“Of course not, Queen Dreck,” Wigaldo said. He poured himself a cup of tea. He took a deep breath. And he drank. 

But what Queen Dreck didn’t know, was that none of the tea was reaching Wigaldo’s throat! Clever Wigaldo had tied a small sack to a tooth. It was now sitting empty inside of his cheek. As he poured the tea into his mouth, it only filled up the sack!

Wigaldo put down the empty cup and licked his lips. “Are you ready for your tea now, my Queen?” he said.

Queen Dreck frowned. “Yes, Wigaldo,” she said. “I would have liked to see something bad happen to you. But I will have my tea instead.”

So Wigaldo poured a nice full cup of tea for the queen. She drank it down in one big gulp! A moment later, she was fast asleep. Wigaldo snatched the magic crown from her head. Queen Dreck didn’t stir. Wigaldo ran from the room and into the streets. He waved the crown high above his own bald head as he ran.

“We are free! We are free!” he cried with joy to the cheering crowd. And they were.
<br><br>Passage 3: <b>Finals</b><br>It was the last few minutes of the last soccer game of the season. The finals.  Whoever won this game, won it all. And Miranda wanted to win more than anything.

The sky was a clear, cloudless blue. The late afternoon sun was bright and golden. Miranda could see it glinting off the table of trophies. Parents, siblings, and kids from other teams lined one side of the field. Some were sitting in the grass. Some were munching hot dogs. But all eyes were on the game. The score was 1-1, with just 3 minutes to go.

Miranda looked out at her teammates. Every member of the Panthers wore a royal blue jersey. Each one had their number on the back. They were scattered across the field, but they flowed together like water. They ran in almost perfect step. They passed the ball like they were mind-readers. They had practiced and practiced for this. And they were good. Really good. But there was a problem.

For every royal blue jersey, there was an orange jersey to match. The Rockets. They weren't a very good team. But they played rough. That was the problem. The girls on the Rockets had a bad habit. They liked to foul players when the ref wasn’t looking. Their coach never seemed to be looking either. And when they did get called, they were suddenly all smiles and pigtails. But what did grown ups know about what happened on the field, anyway? On the field it was kids vs. kids. The rest was just details. 

And now they had reached the final game. The game they had been working for all season. They had to win. 

Miranda saw the ball come sailing towards her. She ran and met it as it landed. She ran faster, tapping the ball along with her. She was almost at the Panther’s net! But just then a defender popped up in front of her. The girl was like a human wall. Miranda couldn't get past her. She looked around quickly. Her teammate Vanessa was on her left! She passed the ball to Vanessa and Vanessa took the shot! The ball soared towards the net. But the goalie’s hands were too quick! The goalie punched the ball away. It flew off behind the goal post. 

The whistle blew. Corner kick for the Panthers. Miranda checked her watch. Just one minute left in the game. This was going to be their last chance. Kaitlyn went to take the corner. Kaitlyn had a kick so powerful that she had dented a parking sign once! Almost every member of the Panthers crushed in around the net. It was all a jumble of blue and orange. The whistle blew again. Kaitlyn took the kick.

With a powerful THWACK the ball spun high in the air! It arched over the first few players. Miranda watched it like it was happening in slow motion. She saw the ball starting to drop towards her. She saw the goalie drifting towards the left side of the net. She felt a Rockets player tugging on her jersey. She jumped up and headed the ball! The Rockets goalie reached for it, but it was no use. The ball plunged deep into the right side of the net! 

Nobody heard the final whistle over the screams of joy from the team and the crowd. Everyone rushed the field! They had done it! They had won!

Then, she went on her way.

She hummed as she walked. Suddenly the crow flew over her head again. It landed in a tree just ahead of her. It watched her walk. She looked at it again, but didn’t stop. Its sparkling black eyes met hers. She felt a cold shiver run down her neck. She passed the crow and started walking faster. Then she heard the flapping sound again. 

Nelly saw the crow land in a tree right in front of her.  She wasn’t humming anymore. She started to run. The sky was almost black. The flapping sound was closer now. She didn’t look back but she knew: the crow was right behind her.

""No wonder it is still,"" she whispered again. ""I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.""

She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid of awakening some one. She was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.

""I wonder if they are all quite dead,"" she said. ""Is it all a quite dead garden? I wish it wasn't.""

Then she heard a noise downstairs.

“Rrrrreeeeeennnnnnnh.”

It sounded like a monster. No - a witch! A screaming, creepy witch.

“RrrreeeEEENNNnnnnh.”

Sierra turned up her music and tried to ignore it. But it cut through the comforting sounds.

“RrrEEEENNNNNH.”

It sounded like it was coming from the kitchen.

Sierra got up all her courage. She turned off the music and cracked open her bedroom door. The house was quiet. Could she have imagined it? She crept into the hallway. It was dark, but a single light from the kitchen glowed at the bottom of the stairs.

“RrrreennnNNNNhhhh!”

Sierra jumped! There was definitely a witch down there in the kitchen. She had thought she was too old to believe in witches, but this was proof they existed. Nothing else could be making a noise like that. Sierra could picture the witch perfectly. She knew it would be crouched in the corner, beside the counter. It would have black robes and a horrible, warty nose. And it would reach out its crooked, bony fingers towards her…

Sierra took a deep breath. No matter what, the witch was going to get her. But she had to see it first. She tiptoed very, very quietly down the stairs. The yellow light glowed through the railing. Slowly, the kitchen came into view. The tile floor...no witch yet. The microwave...still no witch. The dishwasher, the counter, the corner…

Sierra stopped, still crouched on the stairs. Where was the witch? Was it invisible? Had it magically moved behind her? Was she about to feel those bony fingers on her shoulder?

“RRRRREENNNNNNNHHHHH!”

Sierra screamed! Then she stopped. Because even though the noise sounded louder and even more horrible up close, it wasn’t coming from a witch.

People say that the Coat Woman lives deep in the dark forest. Some people say she lives in the heart of a tree. Others say that she sleeps under the river. Only a very few souls have actually seen her. Or at least, only a few have been able to come back and tell about it.

She is tall. Very tall, for a woman (if that is what she is). She has dark glossy hair. The top half of her face is as pale as the moon. Nobody has ever seen the bottom half. It is always covered by the large collar of her great and mysterious coat. 

She is never seen without the coat. It seems to be too big for her. It falls all the way down to her feet and drags on the ground behind her. The sleeves are wide and sweeping. It is always said to be made of some thick, heavy material, but the color is disputed. Some people say the coat looks dark and soft like moss. Others say it is as pale and layered as the fog. One rare tale tells of the coat glowing like the light reflecting off a cat’s eye in the night.

But what is on the outside of the coat is less troubling than what lies on the inside. Some people think she has no body at all. The woman never speaks, but strange sounds come from under that coat: the calls of birds that don’t exist, the howling of strong winds, a chime that reminds you of something you lost in childhood. Nobody knows what is under her coat. Nobody wise wants to know. So if you ever see her in the deep, dark forest, don’t let your curiosity get the best of you. Or else the Coat Woman might get the best of you too. 

 
<br><br>Passage 2: <b>The Dollhouse</b><br>The dollhouse sat alone on the sidewalk corner. Jamal got off his bike and walked towards it. There was no moon that night and it was dark. The <i>tik-tik-tik</i> of the bike wheel was the only sound on the street.

The house had only three sides so that he could look right into it. It had three floors and lots of little rooms. The outside was dirty and scratched but the inside was shiny and looked brand new. Jamal had never played with a dollhouse before. He leaned in closer to look at the little kitchen and the little bedroom. He liked the tiny lamps. He liked the tiny fridge with the even tinier fridge magnets. He slowly reached out a finger to touch a tiny milk jug– but then he heard people whispering. He turned quickly but saw no one. He was alone on the street. 

Jamal turned back towards the dollhouse. One of the tiny lamps was glowing with a soft, yellow light. Had that light been on before? The whispering began again. Suddenly Jamal wanted to have this dollhouse more than anything in the world. He needed to have it. It was his.
<br><br>Passage 3: <b>Growing</b><br>The vines were just growing and growing– they wouldn’t stop! They coiled around Beth’s ankles so she couldn’t run. They spiraled up her legs like strong green snakes. They grew and grew, faster and faster! The vines wound around her torso. Beth struggled hard, trying to fight them off. But every time her fist broke free, more vines sprouted up and pinned her arms back down! They were like evil, living ropes! Beth could hear them rustling in her hair beside her ears. And then suddenly all she could see was green, and then black. They were growing over her eyes! She opened her mouth wide to scream but the vines were too quick! They grew over her mouth until her scream was no more than a muffled moan. Now Beth blended in perfectly with the other plants on the forest floor. Just the way they liked it.
<br><br>Passage 4: <b>The Old Man's House</b><br>“What can you see?” Zach whispered to Bradley. Bradley was standing on Zach’s shoulders peeking into a house window.

“Um, nothing yet,” Bradley said quietly. “It’s pretty dark in there.”

“Well, you better hurry up! You aren’t exactly light as a feather, you know.”

“I don’t know about this, Zach,” Bradley said. “What if the old man never did anything? Then we’re just spying on him like creeps!”

“If you want to get out of here, that’s fine by me. I don’t think I can hold your big butt up much longer anyway.”

But just then Bradley did see something inside the house. A light began flickering up the wall like it was being reflected by a mirror. Bradley leaned in closer. He grabbed onto the windowsill with both arms and pressed his nose against the glass. The spot of light on the wall was growing bigger and bigger. It was turning from yellow to pink to green.

Just then the old man’s face appeared in the light! He was staring right at Bradley! Bradley screamed and Zach fell over. But Bradley was left hanging off the windowsill!

She saw her wispy eyebrows grow into bushy tufts that hung down over her eyes. She saw Mrs. Finnegan shudder and bend as a large lumpy hump burst from her back. Worst of all were the sharp, shining fangs that slid out from between Mrs. Finnegan’s thin lips. Just then Mrs. Finnegan opened her mouth wide and a stream of wet, screeching bats flew out!

The tall pale flowers in vases on either end of it swayed and trembled. A wild pounding was coming from within the glossy black box, harder and harder until the sides began to shudder. Though the lid had been locked tight, it was starting to lift, inch by inch. A strange green light was leaking out through that gap under the lid. It was the light that scared Ed most of all. Years later when he lay down to sleep, he could still see it shining behind his eyelids.

967,1080,7,6,"Passage 1: <b>Scary Basement</b><br>Maia opened the door to the basement, where the sounds had been coming from. Steps descended into the dark. 
<br><br>Passage 2: <b>Digging</b><br>Every night that week Mustafa had woken up to the same sound. He would be lying still in his soft bed, when suddenly the loud <i>CLANG</i> of metal on metal would make his eyelids shoot open in a jolt. Then came the sounds of digging. The soft shuffle and hiss of dirt being spilled over dirt, again and again.

The first time it had happened, Mustafa woke up confused and on edge in the dark. Once he realized that he had just been startled out of a dream, he relaxed a little and rolled over, ready to go back to sleep. But then he heard the digging coming from outside his window. 

Mustafa’s bedroom was on the first floor of their apartment building, and its window faced out into a beautiful gated courtyard. All the other apartment buildings looked into that courtyard and it was filled with trees, and flower beds, and wooden benches. During the daytime, the courtyard would be filled with little kids running around, and older folks sitting in the shade to read. But at night it was filled with nothing but shadows, and the tall black metal gates that surrounded it were firmly shut, chained, and locked.

At first Mustafa just lay there on his side, gazing out of his window, listening. He had never heard more than the mewling of a cat in the courtyard at night, and this was definitely no cat. From where he lay, he could just see the sharp pointed black tips of the gate glinting in the silvery moonlight, and all of the dark, dark night sky beyond. The sound of the digging continued steadily: a jab, a muffled patter of dirt, a low whispering sound as it scattered and slid.

Mustafa knew Joseph, the man who tended the trees and gardens in the courtyard. He knew that Joseph obsessed over his gardens, and only ever dug in them during the day because he believed that plants liked peace at nighttime, just like people. He also knew that Joseph was the only person with the keys to the courtyard gate. So, who was this digging in the courtyard in the middle of the night? And what were they digging for?

Mustafa no longer felt like going back to sleep. He didn’t think he could have if he tried. His heart was starting to beat a little louder in his chest, and he noticed that the hand gripping his blanket was sweaty. Slowly, he pulled the blankets back and slid out of his bed. He crawled across the floor to the window, not wanting his head to be seen. He paused just below it and crouched, listening.

<i>Jab, patter, whisper; jab, patter, whisper</i>– was it getting faster? Mustafa took a deep breath, held it, and inched his head up to peer through the bottom of the window. 

Fifteen feet from where Mustafa knelt, through the gate and across the grass was a large pit in the ground. Mounds of black earth were piled all around it, and a vivid orange glow was coming from its unseen depths. Closest to Mustafa were a couple of objects covered in dirt. The first was a large tattered book, leather-bound, but too filthy to read the title of. The other was a headdress of some kind, or a crown. Its metal was carved with detailed markings and it had jewels or stones embedded all across its surface. As Mustafa stared out at it, his widening eyes reflecting both the pale moon and the strange orange light, he finally let out his breath in a gasp as he realized: set into the crown were not jewels, or stones, but hundreds and hundreds of human teeth.

Suddenly a slow creaking sound rose up from the bottom of the pit and Mustafa ran back to his bed and jumped under the covers. Turning his back to the window he tried to steady his breath which was coming hard and fast. He tried closing his eyes, willing himself to go back to sleep and awake to find this had all been a terrible dream, but every time his eyelids closed the image of the crown was there waiting for him. Even under the blankets on that warm night, Mustafa lay there shivering for a long time before he finally fell asleep.



The next morning Mustafa rose slowly, sitting up and letting the smoky scent of bacon wash over him pleasantly before even opening his eyes. Once they were open, he blinked dully at a shadow on his wall, a shadow cast by the pointed tips of the metal courtyard gate.

And suddenly, with a feeling like an icy stone falling into his stomach, he remembered. Nearly tripping over his own feet in his hurry to reach the window, when he got there he breathed a deep shuddering sigh of relief. He even let out a little laugh. 

Looking out into the sunny courtyard, everything was just as it should be. A man with a coffee cup was on a bench reading a magazine. A woman and her small daughter were having a tickle fight under a large oak tree. No pit. No orange light. No crown. 

<i>What a terrifying dream that was! </i>Mustafa thought to himself. <i>I’ve really gotta cool it on those late-night movies Mom hates. Maybe there is such a thing as too-vivid an imagination.</i>

And he went to go have breakfast with his family.



That night Mustafa yawned and leaned back into his pillows, already wondering what his dad might be making for breakfast the next day when he gently drifted off to sleep. 

Then he heard a <i>CLANG</i>, followed by the unmistakable sounds of digging.

	Clap clap, on! 
	Clap clap, off! 
	Asher could sit there and do it all day. It was like magic! 
	Sometimes he would try different sounds. Not all the sounds worked.

	Some sounds worked better than others. But the only sound that always worked was clapping. 
	That’s why Asher was sitting with the lamp when his little sister came in. He was practicing the perfect clap. She jumped into the room in her hot pink tutu. She had sparkly goop smeared across her cheeks.
	""Clearly you are ready to clap,” she said, her nose high in the air. ""That’s good. Because I am ready to perform! I am ready for my spotlight!” She stepped into the glow of the lamp. Then she started her ballet steps.

Mom’s footsteps come up the stairs. I hide in my closet.

""Come on, sleepyhead, ” Mom says, coming into my room. ""It’s time to go to sleep.”

I stay still. I stay silent. I hold my breath.

The closet door opens.

""Ok,” she says. ""One quick story.”

""Yes!” I shout.

I jump on my bed and slide under the blanket. Mom sits next to me. I hand her my favorite book, and she starts to read.

The story is really good. It’s about a dragon. I love stories about dragons. I’m happy that Mom is reading to me. I am more happy that I don’t have to go to sleep. I hate bedtime. Sleeping is boring. I’m not tired.

<br><br>Passage 3: <b>The Sandcastle Monster</b><br>My name is Holly. It is a hot summer day. My family is going to the beach.

When we get to the beach we eat lunch. I eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. My little brother, James, eats gross baby food. My mom and dad eat gross adult food. I eat my sandwich fast because I want to go play.

When I am done eating I take out my shovels and buckets. I have three shovels and two buckets. My red bucket is for making towers. My blue bucket is round. My shovels are all different sizes.

It is time to build the sandcastle. The first thing I have to do is make a big pile of sand. At first it is easy to dig. The sand is not heavy. I dig deeper. The sand is getting heavier. Now it is not so easy to dig.

My pile of sand is huge now. It is taller than James. Now it is time to start carving my sandcastle.

I push on the pile of sand with both hands to make it stronger. Then I fill my red bucket with sand, and dump it upside down on the pile. This is how I make the towers. When I slowly take off the bucket, there is a tower. I make three more towers.

I use my smallest shovel to make windows in the towers. I use my medium shovel to make doors in the towers. I use my biggest shovel to make the towers stronger.

Now it is time to dig a moat. A moat is a hole all the way around the castle that you fill with water. At first it is easy to dig. The sand is not heavy. I dig deeper. The sand is getting heavier. Now it is not so easy to dig.

I use all the extra sand I dig up to make a wall around the castle. It is time to fill the moat with water. I walk down to the ocean, and fill my blue bucket with water. James tries to follow me and my dad picks him up.

The bucket is too heavy to carry so I dump some water out. It is hard to walk, but I make it back to the sandcastle. I dump the water in the moat. It barely fills any of the moat. This is going to take a lot of trips to the ocean.

I go back and forth many times. Finally, the water is starting to fill the moat. After many more trips, the moat is finally full! I am so tired that I lay down in the sand and close my eyes.

I hear my mom yelling, but it is too late. The sandcastle is destroyed. It was destroyed by a monster. A monster named James. A two-year-old sandcastle monster.

The towers are ruined. The wall is ruined. The moat is ruined.

I am so mad. I am ready to cry. Then James comes over, gives me a big hug, and says “sorry”.

I cannot be mad at James. I hug him back and tell him it is okay. I still love him, even if he <i>is</i> a sandcastle monster.

Nicole looked thoughtful. She tilted her head to one side. “I want to go into space,” she said.

Nicole walked out of the room. A few moments later, Nelson saw her flash past the doorway. She was sprinting down the hallway towards the living room.

He got all the ingredients ready then mashed them up in a bowl. Then he turned on the stove and took out a big pan. Grayson poured the mix into the pan in little circles. Soon it started to cook. 

He flipped the pancakes once. Success! Perfection!

Then his sister Jane came over. Jane started telling Grayson all about her Super Strawberry lip gloss. She waved it in front of his face and put it under his nose to sniff. But Grayson didn’t want his first ever banana pancakes to burn, so he told Jane to go away. 

“Fine!” Jane huffed, stomping away. “I’m going to have a tea party and <i>you’re</i> not invited!” She went to her room and closed the door.

Grayson checked his pancakes, but they still weren't ready yet. Suddenly his brother Ethan flew into the kitchen, attacking Grayson with a pillow. Grayson grabbed the pillow and threw it across the room. Ethan ran after it and came back laughing. 

“What are you doing?” he asked.

Grayson saw that his pancakes were finally done. “Banana pancakes,” he said. He switched off the stove and looked Ethan dead in the eye. “And you’re not having any.” Then Grayson turned back around and slid the pancakes onto a plate. 

“We’ll see about that…” Ethan mumbled. 

Grayson put the plate of pancakes down on the table. Then he walked across the room to the fridge and grabbed the maple syrup. Then he opened the drawer and pulled out a knife and fork. But when he got back to his plate, both Ethan and the plate of pancakes were gone!

Grayson looked around, but they were nowhere to be found. Just when Grayson was about to explode with anger, he heard a small laugh. <i>They must be nearby.</i>

He checked under the table, behind the couch, and even in the shower! Then he realised there was one place he had never checked. <i>The big cabinet under the sink.</i>

Grayson ran over to the cabinet. But before he got a chance to pull open the doors, Ethan burst out of it, giggling madly. Without looking back, Ethan wrenched open the front door and ran outside.

Grayson picked the empty plate up off the floor. There wasn’t even a crumb left.

970,1083,10,5,"Passage 1: <b>Loosey-Goosey-Lulu-Stucy</b><br>Lulu Stucy was a pretty laid-back gal. She was curious and she loved to explore. Sometimes she’d get distracted by the call of a strange bird or the swirling pattern in a rock and completely forget where she was going. But she didn’t mind, and that’s why everybody called her Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy. It was also because Lulu had a habit of losing things.

“You’d lose your head if it wasn’t screwed on!” Grandma Lucy Stucy was fond of saying to her. And Lulu never used to mind losing things either, until one day she woke up and just didn’t want to be Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy anymore. She went downstairs and told her older brother Brucey all about it.

“OK,” Brucey Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “I hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

Lulu was wearing a skirt that day and didn’t have any pockets, so she just held the quarter tight in her hand. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to that weird dark stairwell behind the cafeteria, and back to the classroom. But as she was walking home at the end of the day, she looked in her hand and realized the quarter was gone!

“Oh no!” Lulu cried. “I must have put it down somewhere and forgot to pick it back up!”

But the next day her brother gave her a second chance. “OK,” Brucey Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “This time I <i>rinky</i>-<i>dinky</i>-hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

Lulu made sure to wear jeans with pockets that day, so she slipped the quarter into her pocket and forgot all about it. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to the big room with all the blue mats in it beside the gym, and back to the classroom. But as she was walking home at the end of the day, she looked in her pocket and realized the quarter was gone!

“Oh no!” Lulu cried. “There’s a hole in my pocket and I didn’t know! The quarter must have fallen right through!”

But the next day her brother gave her a third chance. “OK,” Brucy Stucy said. “I’m giving you this quarter, Lulu, and if you make it through the whole day without losing it, you won’t be Loosey-Goosey anymore.”

“I won’t lose it!” Lulu said. “This time I <i>winky</i>-<i>finky</i>-rinky-dinky-hinky-stinky-PINKY promise I won’t! This is the end of Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy!” And off she went to school.

This time Lulu wasn’t taking any chances. She opened her backpack and slipped the quarter into a pouch, inside a pocket, zipped up the whole thing and then buckled the flap. Feeling confident, she forgot all about it. She went from the classroom, to recess, to lunch, to the water fountain on the third floor that shot water up your nose, and back to the classroom. As Lulu was walking home along a stream, she noticed a feather on the ground of a kind she had never seen before. She took off her backpack to put the feather inside, but just then her hand slipped and the bag went tumbling down into the stream.

When Lulu got home she was so sad that she could barely hold her head up. “What’s the matter?” asked her brother, Brucey.

“I lost my backpack AND the quarter,” Lulu sniffed. “I’m gonna be Loosey-Goosey Lulu Stucy forever.”

Brucey looked at her. “You know, nobody is good at everything, but everybody has some things that they’re great at. We’re all good at different things and that’s what makes us, <i>us</i>! I don’t lose things very often, but I’m so clumsy that they should call me Brucey-Stucy-Drops-The- Juicy!” Lulu laughed. “And our baby sister sure is cute, but I’m about to start calling her Whoopsie-Poopsie-Baby-Stucy!” The baby giggled in her high-chair. “And Lulu, you might lose things a lot, but you also find things that nobody else sees. Look at that cool feather in your pocket! I’ve never seen one like it!”

Lulu went over and hugged her big brother. “Thanks, Brucey,” she said.

“No problem, sis,” he replied. “Besides, maybe there is a way to stop you from losing things all the time. We haven’t tried duct tape yet!”
<br><br>Passage 2: <b>Sneaky Snacks</b><br>Leah loved snacks. She didn’t see why she couldn’t have them all day. But her mother was very strict about snacktime. If Leah tried to open the snack cupboard, even if her mother was on a different floor of the house, she’d somehow know! “You have to save room for dinner!” she’d say, putting away the crackers. “No candy before bed!” she’d scold, as Leah was about to sneak a chocolate bar. “Marshmallows aren’t for eating, they’re for roasting!” she’d say, twisting up the bag and putting it out of reach.

One day, Leah accidentally left a cookie in her lunch box from school. She remembered it just as she was falling asleep. She sat up in bed and very, very quietly unzipped her backpack. Then she very, very quietly opened her lunch box. Imagine that - not just a snack, but a snack after lights out! That cookie tasted better than any snack Leah had ever had. She had to find a way to do it again.

Leah started to have secret nighttime snacks every time she could. At first, she would sneak little bits of food into her room here and there. But soon she wanted more than just a snack. She wanted a feast!

It took many weeks to sneak enough food, but finally Leah had it all hidden in her room. There was chocolate and candy and cookies and chips; there were even the forbidden marshmallows. Her mother said goodnight and turned off Leah’s light. Leah was so excited she could hardly wait. Very, very quietly, she laid out her feast on the bed. Very, very quietly she took her first bite.

“Leah!” The light flicked on. There stood her mother in the doorway!
<br><br>Passage 3: <b>Not Identical</b><br>First of all, no, we are not identical. Just because we sort of look alike doesn’t mean that we are identical twins.

Yes, Molly and I were born 12 minutes apart.

Yes, we have the same mom and dad.

Yes, we are both girls.

Yes, we both have blue eyes and curly brown hair.

Yes, we are both the same height.

That’s where it stops though. Everything else about us is totally different.

Molly loves reading. I’d rather rake leaves or clean windows than read a book.

Molly gets As on all of her tests. I’ve never even seen an A. Ever.

Molly loves shopping for clothes. I love shopping for sports equipment.

Molly’s name is easy to spell. My name, Kaitlyn, everyone spells wrong. 

See, we’re totally different. People always think we’re identical twins because at first they think we look the same. Once you look closely at us though, you could tell we’re fraternal twins. People don’t usually know the difference.

Fraternal twins are born one after another, just like identical twins. However, fraternal twins could be two boys, two girls, or even a boy and a girl. They also don’t look the same.

Like us.

Molly has a bigger nose. I have bigger lips. Molly also has a big freckle on her right cheek. I don’t.

Although we sometimes get annoyed when people get us confused, it does have its advantages. Like the time we pulled off the greatest twin switch in history. 

It all started at our new school. At the end of third grade, our dad got good news with his company. They moved him up to a vice-president or something. At first Mom was really happy, but then we found out we’d have to move because his new job was about five hours away.

Mom still pretended that she was excited. Molly and I knew better. She was just pretending because she knew Molly and I hated that we had to move. I was a little upset, but Molly was really mad. Molly said she wasn’t going, that she’d live in the basement of the school. Molly is known for being overly dramatic. 

About a year ago, Molly and I were out raking leaves when Molly poked her finger with a small branch. It was the tiniest cut in the world, but you would have thought she had her finger chopped off the way she was screaming. Dad came running out and carried her inside. Yes, she was actually carried inside. 

She got out of raking leaves for the next hour while she <i>rested</i> her finger. Mom wasn’t home at the time - she wouldn’t have fallen for Molly’s trickery. Dad still does though. He’s a sucker for her dramatics.    

Dad moved into an apartment a couple weeks later, until we could find a house. As a compromise, Mom stayed back with us so we could finish the last two months of the school year. The day that school finished, we moved, too.

It was a boring summer because we didn’t know anyone in Pegoria, our new town. About a week before we moved, Dad bought us a house. It was at the edge of this gigantic national forest, which meant that everywhere you looked all you saw were trees and mountains. We did have a cool lake in our backyard, but except for old Ms. Henderson, who lived by herself about a half mile away with her seven cats, there was no one else to play with anywhere near us. The population of the entire town was only 3,000 people! We were excited to start fourth grade so we could make some friends. 

We had never been in the same class before because our old school always wanted twins separated as much as possible. In Pegoria, that wasn’t an option. There was only one fourth grade class. 

We both had Mrs. Pritchett, a grey haired woman who looked like she had been teaching for fifty years. When Mrs. Pritchett introduced us, she mixed up our names.

Not exactly an unusual thing for us.

Normally, Molly jumps right in and corrects anyone who mixes us up. This time though, she didn’t.

I stared at Molly, expecting her to say something. When she finally did, it took me by complete surprise.

“Could you please both tell us a little something about yourself,” Mrs. Pritchett said. “Who would like to go first?”

Molly quickly raised her hand, and gave me a quick glance. I knew that look. A sly and mischievous smile coated in honey and syrup. A smile she’d used countless times to get her way. I knew it was trouble.

“Hi, my name is Kaitlyn,” Molly said. “I just moved here with my sister Molly. I love sports, helping out with chores around the house, and I have to admit, I don’t really like reading.”

The class snickered at the part about reading.

“Thank you, Kaitlyn,” Mrs. Pritchett said. “Alright, Molly. Tell us something about yourself.”

I looked up, realizing she was talking to me. I looked around. The entire class was looking at me. Molly just stood there, her hands clasped together, staring at me as well with her twisted smile.

I didn’t want to do it, but I didn’t really have a choice. I opened my mouth and said the words I would regret for years to come.

Elias and his best friend, Pete were going to climb the Chief together that summer. The Chief was the second biggest, free-standing chunk of granite in the world! And they were going to climb it.

That is, they were going to climb it until Elias’ parents said, ""No."" His parents also said they were going to fly to the world's flattest place to visit his grandparents. In the middle of nowhere. And Elias really didn’t want to go on that stupid trip at <i>all</i>.

""Can I have a piece?” Mindy asked John. 

""Sure!” John said. ""There's plenty to share!"" He passed Mindy his pack of gum.

""Me too?” asked Angela. ""Minty gum is my absolute favourite!"" Mindy passed the pack to Angela.

""Me too?” asked Steven. ""My breath is really bad! I had tuna and onions for lunch. Yuck!"" Angela passed the pack to Steven.

""Me too?” asked Jenna. ""If I don't chew gum, I'll bite my nails! My mom hates it when I bite my nails."" Steven passed the pack to Jenna.

Finally, Jenna passed the pack back to John. John reached in to get a piece of gum. But the pack was empty! John's friends felt really bad. They all took the chewed up gum out of their mouths. 

""Sorry John,"" Mindy said. ""Do you want some of ours? There's plenty to share!""

<br><br>Passage 2: <b>The Big Slide</b><br>Kayla is scared of the big slide. It is green, and it is in her backyard. Her older brother, Ben, loves the slide. 

""It’s too big,” Kayla says. Kayla plays on the swing. The swing is next to the slide. She watches Ben. 

Ben climbs up the ladder. He sits down at the top of the green slide. Then he pushes himself down. ""Yipee!” he yells.

""Do you want to try, Kayla?” Ben asks.

Kayla shakes her head no. ""It’s too big,” Kayla says.

The next day the Spencers come over to play. Aidan is Ben’s age. Megan is Kayla’s age.

""Do you want to go down the slide?” Ben asks Aidan.

""Yes!” Aidan says.

Aidan and Ben go to the slide. Megan and Kayla go to the swing. Aidan climbs up the ladder. He sits down at the top of the green slide. Then he pushes himself down. ""Yipee!” he yells.

""Do you want to try?” Aidan asks the girls.

Kayla shakes her head no. ""It’s too big,” Kayla says.

""I want to try it,” Megan says. She gets off the swing. She walks over to the slide. Megan climbs up the ladder. She sits down at the top of the green slide. Then she pushes herself down. ""Yipee!” she yells.

Megan comes back to the swing. ""It’s fun,” she says. Kayla doesn’t say anything.

""Do you want to try?” Megan asks Kayla.

""It’s too big,” Kayla says.

""I’ll go with you,” Megan says. Kayla doesn’t say anything.

""Please!” Megan begs.

""Ok,” Kayla says. Kayla gets off the swing. She walks over to the slide with Megan. She looks up at the big slide. It’s so big!

Kayla and Megan climb up the ladder. They sit down at the top of the green slide. Then they push themselves down. ""Yipee!” they yell.

""Wasn’t that fun?” Megan asks.

""Yes!” Kayla says. ""Let’s do it again.” The boys and girls take turns going down the slide all morning.

After lunch, the Spencers go home. Ben and Kayla go back outside.

""I told you the slide was fun,” Ben says.

""I know,” Kayla says. ""I wish it was bigger!”
